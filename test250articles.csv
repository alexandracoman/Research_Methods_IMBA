They finally have the means to test John Wheeler’s delayed-choice theory and concluded that the physicist was right.

In 1978, Mr Wheeler’s proposed experiment involved a moving object that was given the choice to act like a wave or a particle – the former acting as a vibration with a frequency that can distinguish it from other waves and the latter having no frequency that you can determine its position in space, unlike a wave – and at what point does it ‘decide’ to act like one or the other.

Debka (h/t Marvin W) DEBKAfile’s exclusive sources report that the Trump administration has resolved to scrap all ties with the Palestinian leadership in retaliation for its campaign against US President Donald Trump and his Jerusalem policy. Several warnings to Mahmoud Abbas (aka Abu Mazen) of what was in store if he did not desist from castigating the US president fell on death ears.

Last week, two Arab crown princes, Saudi Muhammed bin Salman and UAE Sheikh Muhammed bin Zayed, summoned Abbas to their capitals and urged him strongly to back away from his attacks on President Trump. He got the same advice from the ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Al Thani, who conferred with Washington on the subject – all to no avail. The Trump administration has therefore set out an eight-point program of sanctions, first revealed here:

The Israeli-Palestinian peace plan under preparation in Washington will not be submitted to Ramallah – only to Israel and the relevant Arab governments.

US-Palestinian interaction is to be suspended – not just at the senior levels but in day-to-day interchanges. The administration has notified Palestinian and other Arab parties to stop addressing queries on political and economic matters to the US consulate in Jerusalem, because they will not receive answers.

The status of the PLO office in Washington will be reevaluated with a view to shutting it down.

Palestinian officials will no longer be invited to Washington by the US government, including the State Department and Department of Treasury.

Above all, they will not be welcome at the White House or the National Security Council where US Middle East policy is designed. Senior US officials congratulated the senior Palestinian negotiator Saab Erekat, who also holds the PA’s American portfolio, on his recovery from illness, at the same time warning him that he would no longer be received at the White House.

The Trump administration will not make any public announcement of the cutoff of financial aid to the Palestinians. Since the funds are mostly earmarked for specific economic projects, each allocation will simply be held back on the pretext of the need for a “reappraisal.”

The US will halt its contributions to the UN Work and Relief Organization, an estimated one billion dollars per annum.

The US administration moreover intervened with the governments of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar with a request that they freeze or slow their economic aid to the Palestinian Authority.

According DEBKAfile’s sources, Palestinian officials in Ramallah were devastated by news of the sudden cutoff of the main sources of the PA’s revenue. Even the Qatar ruler, whom Abbas visited last week as a last resort to save the PA from economic meltdown, refused to release any more funding.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"MORE WINNING!

“When the police finally left the campus, around 11 a.m., nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard — five of whom had been shot in the head.”

At 5 o'clock on the morning of November 13, more than 200 Haitian police officers raided the Grand Ravine area of Port-au-Prince. There was a series of loud explosions, followed by gunfire. For the next six hours, the commotion didn’t stop. The neighborhood was under siege.

What had started as an anti-gang operation in a poor and largely forgotten neighborhood — in a poor and largely forgotten country — ended in the summary execution of innocent civilians on a school campus.

The police officers were working with the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. It was launched in October, a reboot of a previous mission that had begun in 2004, when thousands of U.N. troops were sent to Haiti following a coup d’etat, tasked in part with restoring stability and reinforcing national police capacities.

And though the U.N. mission issued a statement days after the raid calling for a prompt investigation by Haitian authorities, it did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation. But in late December, a U.N. spokesperson confirmed to The Intercept for the first time that the mission had helped plan the raid, though it distanced itself from the civilian deaths.

“The reported civilian death[s] were not part of the planned operation but of a unilateral action conducted by some [Haitian police] officers after the conclusion of the operation,” the spokesperson, Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, wrote in an email. The raid of the school, according to the U.N. statement, was done without authorization, without alerting the police hierarchy, and outside of the operational plan.

“The U.N. mission did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation.”

Boutaud de la Combe said that, a day after the raid, the U.N. “conducted an internal enquiry with all the unit commanders who participated in the operation.” The U.N. inquiry, not previously reported, absolved the U.N. finding that U.N. police did not fire their weapons and only “secured the perimeter” of the school, she said.

“None of the [U.N. police] unit proceeded to the location at Maranatha College where the alleged killings took place,” the spokesperson wrote. “The planned portion of the operation went relatively well. The post-operation unilateral initiative of some HNP members to conduct a high risk search, proceeding outside of the operational cadre, without advising the hierarchy, without authorization and contravening the operation plan was not part of the planned operation.”

When I arrived at the Maranatha Evangelical College campus, traveling with a broadcast team from Al Jazeera four days after the raid, it was immediately obvious something heinous had transpired.

The blood that stained the concrete was still wet, unable to dry in the blanket of fog and mist that kept the capital unusually cool that particular week. Water pooled in the courtyard’s clogged drain had turned a dark red, partially obscuring an empty tear gas canister. The smell of the violence still hung in the heavy air.

Classrooms and offices had been ransacked, the contents of closets, drawers, and bookcases spilled across the floors and through the doorways. Light crept in through holes left by bullets that had pierced through the thick concrete. Sometime since the raid, someone had swept another five empty tear gas canisters and close to 100 heavy artillery shells into a pile.

“Water pooled in the courtyard’s clogged drain had turned a dark red.”

The morning we arrived, faculty and students were meeting to mourn those who had been killed. The school was still closed. They gathered in one of the small classrooms, closed the door to us outsiders, and began to sing. The religious hymns — deep, soulful melodies — echoed throughout the courtyard where they mixed with cries of grieving victims and family members anxious to tell their stories.

“I must kill myself,” Monique Larosse, whose nephew was shot in this courtyard days earlier, told us. “Why did they kill him when they know he was not one of the bad men? He was someone who went to church, studied, and had principles.”

The stories Larose, along with other survivors and family members, told me make clear something went horribly wrong on that mid-November day. While there’s a lot still unclear, one thing is for certain — the official narrative is at odds with what the people of Grand Ravine say they witnessed and experienced. And they are a far ways off from finding justice.

Located near the southern entrance to Haiti’s sprawling capital, Grand Ravine is built on a hillside with picturesque views of the Caribbean Sea. And yet, it’s a downtrodden neighborhood.

Haphazard construction with paltry regulation has left neighborhoods, including Grand Ravine, with little to no infrastructure or government services. Many areas are only accessible by foot.

Narrow, misshapen alleys ascend through the concrete homes secured with rusted sheet metal.

Amid all this is the Maranatha Evangelical College, which has operated here since the 1940s. Despite the name, it offers classes for neighborhood kids beginning in preschool. The campus is a mashup of school buildings, houses and a healthy number of full-size trees, a dissonant image in a city overwhelmed by concrete. A low wall marks it off from the surrounding area.

The only entrance to the elevated campus is a sloping, winding road that sits behind a large metal gate. The campus is a refuge, an oasis of calm in a section of Haiti rife with gang activity.

Grand Ravine is a “red zone,” the label international forces give to the country’s most violence-prone areas. In December 2016, Grand Ravine’s most powerful gang leader, Junior Decimus, was arrested at the airport when he attempted to travel abroad. Soon after, according to a report by local rights organization Justice and Peace, an armed conflict began as others sought to consolidate control of the neighborhood. “Bursts of automatic weapons sang during the day, while police officers from the nearby station watched helplessly,” according to a hard copy of the organization’s report.

In October, the month before the police raid, groups of armed youth set up roadblocks, robbing cars in plain sight as they passed.

“The official narrative is at odds with what the people of Grand Ravine say they witnessed and experienced.”

The same month, thousands of U.N. soldiers stationed in the country since the 2004 coup d’etat withdrew. Brought to Haiti to restore “stability,” the foreign troops have been involved in multiple deadly raids into neighborhoods similar to Grand Ravine. The international community has spent hundreds of millions training the Haitian police for the U.N.’s eventual departure.

The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti ended its mandate in October, but the U.N. is by no means gone. In place of troops, the U.N. created a smaller successor mission composed of a few thousand police officers. In early November, together with the local police force responsible for the capital, that new U.N. mission helped plan the anti-gang raid into Grand Ravine.

The November 13 raid was one of the first major acts involving the new mission, and the response will define the future of the U.N.’s relationship with the people of Grand Ravine — and the success of the newly empowered local police force.

At 6:30 on that mid-November morning, Armand Louis received a phone call from Maranatha College, the school he has directed for the last 30 years. Something was wrong. The police raid had spilled onto the school’s campus.

When he arrived nearly two hours later, tear gas was already being employed by police, according to an investigation by the National Network of Human Rights Defenders, a local human rights organization known by its French acronym, RNDDH, and confirmed in an interview with Louis. The following account is based on Intercept interviews with multiple witnesses, whose recollections mirror those included in RNDDH’s subsequent report on the massacre.

Police opened and searched classrooms, ransacking them in an apparent attempt to locate gang members hiding on campus. They didn’t find any.

There was a brief period of calm. People still on campus gave water to police. The burning in their eyes from the tear gas subsided.

An hour later, Louis said, the school’s guard, Julio Fongene, approached him and said that a number of gang members had threatened him and were hiding in a storage facility on campus. Louis informed the police.

“The campus is a refuge, an oasis of calm in a section of Haiti rife with gang activity.”

When officers attempted to dislodge the hiding gang members, two police officers were shot. The gang members fled. It does not appear that any were apprehended, as the police have not made public any arrests of those responsible for shooting the officers.

U.N. units composed of police from Jordan and Senegal responded to reports of shots fired and arrived at the school. According to the U.N., they administered first aid to the injured police officers and secured the perimeter.

But on campus grounds, Haitian police proceeded to punish the bystanders caught up in the violence.

First, they shot and killed Fongene, the guard, witnesses said.

Police then accused Louis of setting them up. They dragged him into the central courtyard, where some faculty members and people who live on campus were present. The officers beat him with a chair, causing significant injuries to his head and torso. The Protestant Evangelical Baptist Mission of Haiti, affiliated with the school, included an account of the beating in its statement describing the events, and it was confirmed in an interview with Louis and in the RNDDH report.

Faculty tried to intervene. David Jean Baptiste, a professor, was beaten and then shot five times, including a bullet to the head. The courtyard grounds where he died remained bloodstained for days after.

Vanel Danger lives on the school’s campus and is responsible for the cafeteria. He told The Intercept that an officer put a gun to his head and threatened to pull out his teeth if he didn’t cooperate. Danger dropped to his knees and begged for his life. Danger told the officer he had given him water just an hour earlier, RNDDH reported. Danger was spared. But many more weren’t so lucky.

Louis, bloody and beaten, told The Intercept he was handcuffed by an officer in a U.N. uniform and hauled off to jail.

When the police finally left the campus, around 11 a.m., nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard — five of whom had been shot in the head. Not a single firearm was recovered, suggesting that the killings were “summary executions,” RNDDH reported.

The bodies were not removed until the next afternoon.

Four days after the raid, the alleys that weave around the campus and through the neighborhood’s hilly landscape were largely deserted. Groups of young kids watched us from rooftops. Darting eyes peering from behind small openings in concrete homes followed us throughout the neighborhood.

Very few of them wanted to speak.

“There are many more” victims of this and other shootings, a local resident and student at the school explained. “They are afraid,” added the student, whose name The Intercept is withholding out of concern for their safety.

Though the anti-gang raid ended with a schoolyard massacre, questions linger about what happened outside the campus, where the raid began. At first, the police acknowledged seven civilian deaths — all of which occurred at the school. Overall, the police made 32 arrests, but haven’t acknowledged any deaths outside of the school.

But in its investigation, RNDDH concluded that one of the people found dead on campus had been pulled out of his house in the surrounding neighborhood that morning and brought to the school only after his death.

The total death toll remains unknown.

“Haitian police punished the bystanders caught up in the violence.”

Doresne Jean, director of the Saint Claire morgue in downtown Port-au-Prince, said that eight bodies had arrived from Grand Ravine on Tuesday, the day after the raid — more than the police originally acknowledged. But Jean said there were surely more.

“Maybe the police moved some bodies,” Jean said, “because we had five or six people come here to ask if we had their relatives.” They were not on the list of bodies already received.

Justice and Peace, the local human rights organization that has been monitoring violence in neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine, was one of the first to investigate the massacre. Rovelsond Apollon, an observer there, said his organization had confirmed 12 dead, but that the real total would likely never be known.

Not that many people, even in Haiti, are paying attention to what happens in Grand Ravine. “A hundred or even 200 could die there and nobody would know,” Apollon said.

I don't know how I am going to live without my son,” Gina Napolean told us from the school’s courtyard, the grief visible on her face just four days after the massacre. Her only son, 22-year-old Kens Napoleon, had been the family’s breadwinner. He was killed by a shot to the head. She put the blame squarely on the government, who she accused of “sending the police to kill our children.”

It’s not just that politicians exert control over the police, Apollon said — they are involved with the gangs themselves. His organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire, he explained, and they said the weapons had been provided by politicians. “Politicians and authorities are not innocent in what happened, because they, too, play their part in the violence,” he said. The politicians, for their part, have not publicly addressed these accusations.

But since the raid, nearly every government official or institution has avoided taking responsibility.

Asked about the raid, the police chief simply said it was planned by the local captain and the new U.N. mission. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant told the press that the specifics of field operations were outside his purview. Both blamed poor planning for the bloodshed.

The operation was compromised from the beginning. Police officers told local human rights investigators that confidential information about the operation was circulating even before it took place.

A former Haitian military official later told me that he found out about the raid when he heard it being discussed on an open radio channel on November 12, the day before it was launched. A gang leader later called in to a local radio show, alleging that a rival gang from a different neighborhood had participated with police in the raid itself. Others have suggested the raid was an attempt to recover a cache of guns that authorities had distributed in the neighborhood weeks earlier. And so the rumor mill in Haiti churns.

The U.N.’s statement — that its officers were stationed only at the perimeter of the school — contradicts the statements made by Louis, who told me he was handcuffed by a U.N. agent on campus. The U.N. insists that it was uninvolved because its officers were not in the courtyard, but the entrance where they say they were stationed is set just below the scene of the massacre.

The new U.N. mission is ostensibly focused on justice, but Apollon noted that Haiti has seen many international missions throughout its history. “They all failed,” he said, because they do not understand the Haitian reality.

In Haiti, he said, impunity reigns.

“David Jean Baptiste, a professor, was beaten and then shot five times, including a bullet to the head.”

Nearly two months after the massacre, no one has been publicly held responsible. The police inspector general has completed an investigation and passed it on to a judge, who could order the arrest or dismissal of officers involved. One police officer accused of involvement is already missing, according to the inspector general. Families of nine victims, including those of the two police officers, received a one-time payment of about $1,500 for funeral expenses. But none of the intellectual authors of the botched raid appear to have been identified or questioned.

Instead, it was Louis, the school’s director, who was arrested for complicity in the death of the two police officers. After being publicly beaten with a chair at the school he had overseen for 30 years, Louis was held in a Port-au-Prince jail for more than a week.

Under pressure from religious organizations and the school’s faculty, Louis was eventually released for health reasons. But he still has not returned to the school.

“In a country like mine,” Louis wrote to me weeks later, “it is hard to take our leaders at their word.” That, he continued, was “why we need to know what the real motive [of the raid] was.” The public authorities have not yet interviewed him. Do “they really want everything to be investigated properly?” he said, “or was this all planned?”

Apollon said continued raids would do little to address the fundamental problems afflicting neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine. Rather, violence stems from the total absence of the state in such areas, and it will continue so long as the population’s needs are not met. What residents need, he said, “is education.”

After the raid, the school was closed for two weeks.

“We need school,” a student at Maranatha told me that day in the courtyard. “Without education, what hope do we have?”

“Israel since 1948 has collaborated with the same white supremacist forces which conquered, exploited and oppressed African people and their descendants throughout the world.”

Several news articles were published in early December indicating that Zambian President Edgar Lungu has agreed to host a summit meeting between African Union (AU) member-states and the State of Israel. (See Jerusalem Post, Dec. 3, 2017)

These reports first surfaced during the inauguration ceremony for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nairobi. President Lungu attended the second induction into office of Kenyatta who is the leader of East Africa’s largest economy.

Lungu met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the Kenyatta inauguration events. The Zambian leader was photographed shaking hands with Netanyahu during the meeting.

A similar summit was scheduled earlier in 2017 in the West African state of Togo. However, mass demonstrations by Togolese opposition parties and coalitions demanding the resignation of the government of President Faure Gnassingbe for undemocratic practices, forced Lome to postpone the announced summit.

“The Zambian leader was photographed shaking hands with Netanyahu during the meeting.”

Zambia’s largest newspaper the Times reported on December 5 that: “President Edgar Lungu, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week at the re-inauguration ceremonies for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nairobi, told ZNBC that ‘For whatever reason, we have been given the mandate to host this summit which will bring its own benefits to Zambia.’ President Lungu said Prime Minister Netanyahu had asked Zambia to host an Africa-Israel summit that was originally scheduled for Togo in September.”

Despite this claim of mystification by President Lungu, it is quite obvious that there were definite reasons why Zambia was targeted to host the meeting. The Southern African state is one of the few countries within the AU which has a military attache stationed in Israel where it opened an embassy in 2015. Israel does not have an embassy in Zambia.

Lungu paid a state visit to Israel in February 2017. The president was accompanied by a large delegation of ministers from his administration.

After his return to Zambia, Lungu was quoted in the Times as saying: “Israel is a pacesetter in survival instinct because it has a desert; but they have a thriving education, agriculture and information and communication technology sectors and we can explore and learn from them. A lot of benefits are expected out of this trip.”

“Zambia is one of the few countries within the AU which has a military attache stationed in Israel where it opened an embassy in 2015.”

Unfortunately, no statement was recorded in the same publication which cites the plight of the Palestinian people who share a similar history with Africans as it relates to colonialism and imperialism. Israel under successive leaders since 1948 has collaborated with the same white supremacist forces which conquered, exploited and oppressed African people and their descendants throughout the world.

The Times then quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while he was in Kenya for the inauguration of Kenyatta as emphasizing in regard to Zambia that Tel Aviv’s aim was to: “deepen its cooperation with the country, which I think is important for both our countries and both our peoples. I know that you’re opening a Jewish history museum in Zambia and soon a synagogue in the capital city. I hope one day I have the opportunity to visit those institutions and to visit Zambia.”

Africa and Israel: A comparative history

Although Jewish people were subjected to national discrimination in Europe and the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries, today since the recognition of the State of Israel by the United Nations in May 1948 most people do not consider them to be an oppressed people. However, it is important to make a distinction between Judaism as a religion and Zionism as an ideology and political movement.

In fact when the founders of the World Zionist movement began in the later years of the 19th century, its leaders specifically sought to align themselves with the rising tide of colonialism throughout Asia and Africa. During the early phase of the Zionist movement Palestine was not the only location examined for the establishment of a Jewish state. (See Weizmann and Smuts: A Study in Zionist-South African Cooperation. Institute for Palestine Studies Monograph No. 43, 1975)

Other areas considered by the Zionists included territories in Africa such as modern-day Madagascar, Uganda and Libya. By 1917, British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour issued his famous declaration which mandated the creation of a state for the Jewish and Arab peoples in the-then colony of Palestine. Most historical literature on this territory prior to 1948 referred to the area as Palestine.

Nevertheless, when the State of Israel was recognized by the UN it was done so as exclusively a Jewish state where millions of Palestinians had been forcibly removed and disenfranchised. In 1948, the UN was dominated by the European colonial powers and the U.S. The Soviet Union, whose military had made the greatest contribution to breaking the expansionist program of the Third Reich under Adolph Hitler, also voted in the UN to recognize the Jewish state in Palestine.

“Palestine was not the only location examined for the establishment of a Jewish state.”

The overwhelming number of colonies in Africa did not gain their independence from European imperialism until after World War II with the upsurge of national liberation movements in Sudan, the Gold Coast (Ghana), Algeria, Tunisia, Kenya, Angola, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Southwest Africa (Namibia), etc. After the century-long existence of the Atlantic Slave Trade which uprooted millions of Africans from the continent to Europe, North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America, the advent of classic colonialism was imposed on the continent.

During 1884-85, the Berlin West Africa Conference was held in Germany. This gathering carved up Africa among the imperialist powers. It would take over a century to bring about the independence of the continent with the Republic of South Africa overthrowing the racist apartheid system in 1994. At present only the Western Sahara, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), remains under the colonial control of the North African monarchy of Morocco.

Africa and Palestine solidarity

After the 1956 Suez Canal war when Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt under President Gamal Abdel Nasser in order to retake control of this strategic asset, the political sympathy of most African states has shifted solidly in the direction of the Palestinian and other Arab people.

Later, as a result of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, a majority of independent African governments and national liberation movements broke relations with Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is viewed by progressive forces throughout Africa as the de facto representatives of the people. After the signing of the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO in 1993, which gave rise to the Palestinian Authority, there has been a period of thawing relations between Tel Aviv and some African states.

However, African solidarity with Palestine remains strong. The Republic of South Africa under the ruling African National Congress (ANC) continues to be a bulwark of sentiment in favor of the recognition of an independent Palestinian state. This mood has existed in Zimbabwe as well during the 37-year presidency of Robert Mugabe, the former leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front Party (ZANU-PF).

“After the signing of the Oslo Accords there has been a period of thawing relations between Tel Aviv and some African states.”

When on December 6 U.S. President Donald Trump issued his executive order to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem mass demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinian people have been held throughout the world. The three leading alliance partners in South Africa, the ANC, South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) have all issued statements decrying the policy decisions of Trump.

The U.S. government is the staunchest supporter of the State of Israel providing billions of dollars in assistance and military hardware on an annual basis. Egypt, due to military and political considerations ranks as the second largest recipient of direct aid from Washington. However, Africa as a whole can in no way compare to the economic, military and diplomatic support which is received by Israel irrespective of the fact that people of African descent in the U.S. are numbered in excess of 40 million inhabitants.

Consequently, the holding of an Israel-Africa Summit in Zambia would represent a tremendous setback in the progressive legacy of independent states on the continent. At this critical stage in international relations AU member countries should be intensifying their cooperation with other fraternal governments and peoples on the continent and indeed throughout the world.

therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.""

--Deuteronomy 30:19 (NKJV)

On the crisp, sunny, fall Columbus Day in 1999, organizers of the ""Say So"" march approached the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court. The marchers, who were predominantly black pastors and lay persons, concluded their three-day protest at the site of two monumental cases: the school desegregation Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and the pro-abortion Roe v. Wade ""rights"" in t he latterconverged in the declaration of Rev. Johnny M. Hunter, the march’s sponsor and national director of Life, Education and Resource Network (LEARN), the largest black pro-life organization.

‘""Civil rights’ doesn’t mean anything without a right to life!"" declared Hunter. He and the other marchers were protesting the disproportionately high number of abortions in the black community. The high number is no accident. Many Americansblack and whiteare unaware of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger’s Negro Project. Sanger created this program in 1939, after the organization changed its name from the American Birth Control League (ABCL) to the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA).

The aim of the program was to restrictmany believe exterminatethe black population. Under the pretense of ""better health"" and ""family planning,"" Sanger cleverly implemented her plan. What’s more shocking is Sanger’s beguilement of black America’s créme de la crémethose prominent, well educated and well-to-dointo executing her scheme. Some within the black elite saw birth control as a means to attain economic empowerment, elevate the race and garner the respect of whites.

The Negro Project has had lasting repercussions in the black community: ""We have become victims of genocide by our own hands,"" cried Hunter at the ""Say So"" march.

Malthusian Eugenics

Margaret Sanger aligned herself with the eugenicists whose ideology prevailed in the early 20th century. Eugenicists strongly espoused racial supremacy and ""purtiy"","" particularly of the ""Aryan"" race. Eugenicists hoped to purify the bloodlines and improve the race by encouraging the ""fit"" to reproduce and the ""unfit"" to restrict their reproduction. They sought to contain the ""inferior"" races through segregation, sterilization, birth control and abortion.

Sanger embraced Malthusian eugenics. Thomas Robert Malthus, a 19th century cleric and professor of political economy, believed a population time bomb threatened the existence of the human race. He viewed social problems such as poverty, deprivation and hunger as evidence of this ""population crisis."" According to writer George Grant, Malthus condemned charities and other forms of benevolence, because he believed they only exacerbated the problems. His answer was to restrict population growth of certain groups of people. His theories of population growth and economic stability became the basis for national and international social policy. Grant quotes from Malthus’ magnum opus, An Essay on the Principle of Population, published in six editions from 1798 to 1826:

All children born, beyond what would be required to keep up the population to a desired level, must necessarily perish, unless room is made for them by the deaths of grown persons. We should facilitate, instead of foolishly and vainly endeavoring to impede, the operations of nature in producing this mortality.

Malthus disciples believed if Western civilization were to survive, the physically unfit, the materially poor, the spiritually diseased, the racially inferior, and the mentally incompetent had to be suppressed and isolatedor even, perhaps, eliminated. His disciples felt the subtler and more ""scientific"" approaches of education, contraception, sterilization and abortion were more ""practical and acceptable ways"" to ease the pressures of the alleged overpopulation.

Critics of Malthusianism said the group ""produced a new vocabulary of mumbo-jumbo. It was all hard-headed, scientific and relentless."" Further, historical facts have proved the Malthusian mathematical scheme regarding overpopulation to be inaccurate, though many still believe them.

Despite the falsehoods of Malthus’ overpopulation claims, Sanger nonetheless immersed herself in Malthusian eugenics. Grant wrote she argued for birth control using the ""scientifically verified"" threat of poverty, sickness, racial tension and overpopulation as its background. Sanger’s publication, The Birth Control Review (founded in 1917) regularly published pro-eugenic articles from eugenicists, such as Ernst Ruin. Although Sanger ceased editing The Birth Control Review in 1929, the ABCL continued to use it as a platform for eugenic ideas.

Sanger built the work of the ABCL, and, ultimately, Planned Parenthood, on the ideas and resources of the eugenics movement. Grant reported that ""virtually all of the organization’s board members were eugenicists."" Eugenicists financed the early projects, from the opening of birth control clinics to the publishing of ""revolutionary"" literature. Eugenicists comprised the speakers at conferences, authors of literature and the providers of services ""almost without the exception."" And Planned Parenthood’s international work was originally housed in the offices of the Eugenics Society. The two organizations were intertwined for years.

The ABCL became a legal entity on April 22, 1922, in New York. Before that, Sanger illegally operated a birth control clinic in October 1916, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, which eventually closed. The clinic serviced the poor immigrants who heavily populated the areathose deemed ""unfit"" to reproduce.

Sanger’s early writings clearly reflected Malthus’ influence. She writes:

Organized charity itself is the symptom of a malignant social disease. Those vast, complex, interrelated organizations aiming to control and to diminish the spread of misery and destitution and all the menacing evils that spring out of this sinisterly fertile soil, are the surest sign that our civilization has bred, is breeding and perpetuating constantly increasing numbers of defectives, delinquents and dependents.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,BlackGenocide.org,,,"['planned parenthood', 'minorities', 'black culture', 'black community', 'racism', 'african-american', 'impact', 'population control', 'margaret sanger', 'birth control', 'eugenics', 'poverty', 'tanya green']",The Negro Project is a devastating eugenic stain on the history of Planned parenthood.,,,
13,20,blackgenocide.org,conspiracy,http://blackgenocide.org/archived_articles/oppose.html,"Why We Oppose Planned Parent Hood ( The following is a reprint of the STOPP's essay ""Why We Oppose Planned Parenthood"") Planned Parenthood is not a benevolent organization trying to strengthen women's rights. It is a cold, calculating group intent on spreading the Humanist religion, luring our children into their web of premarital sex and unlimited abortions, reducing the population of minorities in particula and filling its coffers with the profits from sales of birth control devices. PP COMES BETWEEN PARENTS & CHILDREN



Planned Parenthood pushes what it calls “confidential services” for minors, meaning that PP will provide all types of “reproductive services” to young girls, including potentially dangerous prescription medication and invasive surgery, without their parents’ knowledge. In its 1993-1994 Annual Report, PP bragged of its “unswerving commitment to confidentiality.”



In most states, PP assigns teens a “code name” so that PP can call the girls at home and pretend to be a girlfriend. (Recently, the code names in Springfield, IL; Chicago, IL; and Kingston, NY; were Heather, Nancy and Lucy, respectively.)



As long ago as 1979, the Sunday Independent newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, PA, reported that Planned Parenthood was transporting high school girls out of town, during school hours, to get abortions without the parents being notified.



Planned Parenthood will give minor girls Norplant, Depo-Provera shots, and even abortions without their parents’ knowledge.



PP DOES NOT OPPOSE TEENAGE SEX



Planned Parenthood does not view teenage sex as wrong. PP is upset only if sex results in “unwanted” births. Planned Parenthood’s sex education programs are not about telling children how to avoid sex. They are, rather, designed to indoctrinate our children into what PP calls “responsible sexuality.” By this PP means it is okay for kids to have sex as long as they avoid pregnancy; or if they do get pregnant, have an abortion.



Former PP president Faye Wattleton confirmed this in the Los Angeles Times, on October 17, 1986: “[Planned Parenthood is] not going to be an organization promoting celibacy or chastity.”



The current PP president, Pamela Maraldo, in an article in the March/April 1993 issue of Family Planning World, condemned abstinence-only sex ed programs as “unacceptable.” She endorsed, instead, the position of former United States Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who said, “We’ve taught our children in driver’s education what to do in the front seat, and now we’ve got to teach them what to do in the back seat.”



PP SPREADS RELIGION OF HUMANISM



Planned Parenthood is dedicated to spreading the religious doctrine of Humanism as defined in the Humanist Manifestos (I & II).



PP has consistently refused to give our children a clear message of “right” and “wrong.” It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual.



In the Los Angeles Times article quoted above, Faye Wattleton said, “[Planned Parenthood’s] concern is not to convey ‘shoulds’ or ‘should nots.’”



Fearing that moral people on school boards may lead to schools teaching our young children right from wrong, Pamela Maraldo said, in the article referred to above, “...we must bring an immediate halt to the aggressive infiltration of local school boards by the religious right.”



Any school program endorsed by Planned Parenthood will give children complete information on how to have sex. The children will be given no moral guidance in a PP program and will be told they can do it or not do it depending on how they feel. While this concept of no absolute rights or wrongs may be embraced by some people in the world, it is rejected by most. Most people subscribe to religious principles that recognize a supreme authority over life and a set of divinely inspired principles on which our behavior must be conditioned. Parents who support STOPP are among this latter group and, therefore, oppose all PP programs for teens.



PP POSES A DANGER TO WOMEN



Planned Parenthood runs a business providing birth control devices to its customers. Although PP is officially a non-profit organization, IRS regulations allow it to make profits on parts of its operation. PP does make a profit on its sale of birth control devices and seems to operate more to protect that income than its clients.



A primary example of this is their provision of birth control pills. The Pill has long been a major income producer for PP.



At the Third Annual AIDS Conference in Washington in June 1987, Dr. Frank Plummer of the Kenya Medical Institute reported that oral contraceptive users appear to be less resistant to AIDS than non-users. Still PP refused to get teenage girls and others off the Pill.



Then, Family Planning Perspectives (Vol. 25, No. 6, p. 243) reported: “Women who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and use the pill are more likely than nonusers to have HIV present in their cervical secretions, and may be more likely to infect their sexual partners.” The AGI story goes on to say: “The presence of HIV in cervical secretions was nearly 12 times as likely among pill users as among non-users.”



Still, PP refused to tell its customers to get off the Pill to reduce the risk of AIDS. If PP were really concerned about women, it would stop selling the Pill. However, this would mean about an $85,000,000 decrease in PP income.



This same disregard for women can also be seen in Planned Parenthood’s handling of the Norplant problem. In 1993 and 1994, numerous lawsuits were filed by Norplant users over the side effects of the implants and the difficulty of removal. Yet PP not only continues to make this device available, it still implants it in minors without parental knowledge.

Other types of pets may not be quite so affectionate or even terribly aware of their owners, which makes what this lizard did so shocking. Who knew that lizards could actually communicate with humans? Texas resident Aaron Roman shared the amazing video of his reptile’s reaction to Aaron’s wave, which he caught on video. It appears that the lizard, named Evan, is waving back!

Aaron gave a brief wave towards Evan to make sure he was doing okay since the bearded dragon wasn’t moving much. Imagine his surprise when the lizard gave a wave of “okay” right back at him.

Aaron explained:

“I had gotten Evan for my birthday. One day I walked into my room and saw that he wasn’t moving much. I tried seeing if he’d moved by waving at him, but little did I know that he’d wave back at me. I tried keeping it cool for the video.”

Interestingly, though it appears that Evan is giving his owner a friendly greeting, it’s actually a show of submission that lizards will display when a larger lizard is nearby.

Comments flooded in on Facebook posts about the waving lizard video, with one person pointing out some tough love:

“Yeah. Pretty sure they wave to ward off a threat so jokes on you, your lizard doesn’t love you, it hates you.”

Another commenter gave a lengthy explanation about the lizard’s wave, writing:

“People forget that animals have like a million meanings for different behavior. The reasons that a bearded dragon will wave their arm is not entirely explained. However, it does seem to be a form of communication. A common belief is that arm waving is a passive message, to indicate submission when a larger or more dominant beardie is nearby.

So, he is acknowledging your dominance, which is healthy; you’re the one who knows where the food is. In this case, you don’t really need to reply; he’s essentially being polite.”

The commenter continued to list reasons for the lizard waving, explaining:

“One meaning is species recognition. If a bearded dragon waves at another bearded dragon, it tells the other dragon that he/she is aware of their presence. Young bearded dragons may do a slow ‘wave’ with one of their arms to signal, ‘I’m just a baby! Don’t hurt me!’ Your young beardie may even do this when he sees you walking up to him if he is intimidated by you… We have to remember that even reptiles are not robots; they have moods and personality quirks too that change over time.”

They added this viewpoint about the waving video: “All in all, it can’t hurt to wave back. At best, he’ll be comforted (you’re being submissive too), at worst he’ll be confused. They wave back and forth to each other quite frequently, so he may well appreciate a reply, even if he isn’t expecting one.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Woman Waves Hand In Front Of Lizard’s Tank, Captures Extremely Rare Response On Video",Wendy Michaels,,[''],,,,
18,25,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/man-goes-to-throw-away-christmas-tree-doesnt-realize-dog-is-following-him-ends-in-hilarity/,"Dogs are fantastic. They provide so much joy in our lives. If you are lucky enough to have a pup in your household than you know how great it can be to come home to a happy fur-friend greeting you at the door.

While they are a great addition to the family, dogs can also be a lot of work. They come with a list of daily responsibilities that are added to our already long-growing list of tasks. We have to feed them, walk them, take them to regular vet visits, and train them. For some dogs, training can be a bit more challenging, as certain breeds are more “set in their ways” than others.

And then there are other dogs, who just have love certain holidays.

The two dogs that you will see in the video below, happen to love Christmas. In fact, they love the holiday so much that they put up a big fuss when their owner tries to finally get rid of the Christmas tree.

When this particular family was getting ready to have guests over they decided that it was time to toss their tree out, but it proved to be a much more challenging task than they had expected.

It sounds simple…take the tree out in the backyard and toss it over the fence and into the wooded area.

Well, if you have two Christmas-tree loving dogs, this tasks is a lot harder than expected. The dogs want nothing to do with getting rid of the tree and they are doing their best to keep in their yard.

As the owner is holding one end and attempting to throw it over the fence, the two dogs team up and grip the other end with their teeth, in a fierce game of tug of war. Just when the owner appears to have a steadier grip on the tree, the dogs twist and turn and the owner gets sent over the tree, rolling onto his back on the ground. He gets up quickly, grabs the middle part of the tree and gets down in a squat position while using his whole body to pull the tree up and over the fence, but the dogs are determined to keep the tree in their grips. The owner falls down a second time, and just when he looks like he is going to give up, he lifts the tree one last time and manages to toss it over the fence, releasing the trunk from the dogs’ grip once and for all.

The pups make it clear that they aren’t fans of the tree being on the other side of the tree and they immediately stand up on their hind legs, lean against the tree and bark in refusal.

These are two very determined dogs.

Owners shared their love of the video…

They’re the rulers of the African savannahs that are covered in brown grasses and speckled with sparse trees. Lions’ coloring helps them blend in perfectly with the tall grass so they can ambush their prey as best as possible. And lions are ferocious. Although they’re one of the most powerful predators on land, lions are in danger. Hunters and poachers target lions to prove to the world their machismo.

And while hunters seek to wipe lions off the face of the earth to bolster their egos, the Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuary hopes to stop them and protect the big African cat at all cost.

Richardson has earned the nickname the “Lion Whisperer” for a reason. He aims to educate the world about lions. And for those lucky enough to volunteer alongside Richardson, he encourages them to learn more about lions and help protect the wild species.

“To raise awareness, Kevin has now set up his YouTube Channel ‘LionWhispererTV’. The channel is all about raising awareness about not only the declining numbers of lions but also how this rapid decrease is happening. By watching these videos, you are directly contributing to our scheme of land acquisition,” he writes in his bio.

As part of the volunteer program, Richardson hosts a “volunteer enrichment and lion enrichment” walk. As the name suggests, Richardson takes his group of volunteers out into the savannah of South Africa to hang out with two lions. There, the volunteers meet a male lion, Bobcat, and a female lioness, Gabby. Both lions look ferocious, but are truly “affectionate,” at least that’s what Richardson says. And remember, he’s the lion whisperer, so he’s got an advantage with these deadly big cats.

As Richardson showers the pair of lions with love, the volunteers stay locked in the truck, unwilling to put their lives in danger. And while they are in the vehicle, the lions are just feet from them – and if something goes wrong, they could wind up injured anyway.

Richardson shared the video on his “The Lion Whisperer” YouTube channel. With more than one million hits, this video has proven to be one of his most famous.

The video describes the moment caught on tape as follows:

“It’s an enrichment walk for both the volunteers and the lions as Kevin shows off his lovely lions as well as giving some amazing lion facts to the volunteers.”

Viewers like you are overwhelmed with the magnificent footage. The following are a few comments shared on the video.

“I hope to someday volunteer there with Kevin. I believe in the work and his perspective about conservation. This video makes me want to all the more! Bobcat and Gabby are lovely lions.” “Every time I watch a one of your videos I somehow end up smiling from ear to ear!” “That was so beautiful, wish I could rub my head against a lion.”

Take a moment to watch this video. Would you ever want to volunteer with Kevin Richardson and his lions?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Tourists Grow Nervous As They Approach Wild Lion, One Man Jumps Out And Risks It All",Alexander Smith,,[''],,,,
20,27,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/when-grey-hound-loses-race-owner-takes-extreme-action-vile-footage-going-viral/,"Stories of animal abuse are always tragic, but this one is absolutely devastating. In horrifying cell phone footage, posted to Chinese social media platform, Weibo, a man is seen beating his greyhound to death, screaming throughout the video. According to reports, the man slammed the dog to the ground and repeatedly beat it after he lost money after betting “a fortune” on the dog in a race and losing.

He is even seen saying that he’ll eat the dog, blood dripping from his hands, noting: “listen up dog owners. If your dog is not in a good fit, eat it.”

At one point, he yells: “you made me lose my money!”

Another person on the video explained that the man had spent a lot of money to buy the greyhound and bet a lot on the dog race and the animal lost. Sadly, China doesn’t have laws in place prohibiting animal torture, so even if the man was identified, he wouldn’t face any consequences.

Not surprisingly, people who commented on the Daily Mirror’s Facebook post about the disturbing video were overwhelmingly angry and upset, with one person noting: “I can’t imagine many people will click on this, an absolute vile excuse for a man. I hope he has nothing but misery for the rest of his life.”

Another commenter noted:

“Absolutely heartbreaking. This has me in absolute tears!!! This vile person needs to be shot!!! It’s people like him that give greyhound owners such a bad name!! And why so many people think all racing greys are treated so badly! Luckily most greyhounds have loving owners/trainers and find loving forever homes when their racing days are over!! Both of my greys came from a greyhound adoption trust when they retired, perhaps they should start the same kinds of trusts in China to save these beautiful dogs.”

One commenter believed that the video was at least an important wake-up call to clue in those who are unaware with this type of cruelty exists, writing:

“Thank you for bringing the cruelty involved in Greyhound racing into the mainstream public awareness. Thousands of these gentle dogs lose their lives every year because of this industry and many more suffer a life of social deprivation, kenneled for up to 23 hours a day.”

They also included some helpful information to find out more, noting:

“To find out the harsh consequences of betting on or attending dog racing for the hounds look at CAGED Nationwide or Birmingham Greyhound Protection pages or Google it for yourself.”

Another person couldn’t even read the story, commenting:

“personally couldn’t click to read the details as the simple thought of it was so sickening. The law is simply not severe enough for cruelty to animals and more severe sentencing must be introduced. A life is a life whether human or animal and more protection for animals is called for.”

Day after day, she takes to the White House Press Briefing Room to defend whatever ridiculous thing Trump has done most recently. She’s achieved infamy through her brazen willingness to state literally any absurdity with a straight face.

Today, Sanders faced tough questions regarding the Trump/Russia scandal and ongoing investigation. After tensely attempting to change the subject several times, she finally let reporters know how she really felt.

When questioned about Trump’s tweet regarding the lost FBI text messages, she told reporters exasperatedly, “You guys are obsessed with collusion!” Well, yeah, Sarah. Trump’s criminal behavior matters an awful lot, considering his occupancy of the Oval Office.

I think he thinks there is great cause for concern that five months worth of text messages have gone missing, particularly given the individual as part of that process has already been shown to be extremely biased against the president, and was involved it what seems to be some very inappropriate behavior, and that certainly is of great concern. You guys are absolutely obsessed with everything to do with collusion, if it has anything to do with the president. We hope that you’ll take some of that same obsession, energy, and furor and direct it to some of the places it looks like there could have been some really inappropriate and possibly illegal behavior.

Here’s the video:

Trump’s tweet was referring to an FBI agent who had an affair with a lawyer who worked for the FBI. Texts between the two showed anti-Trump bias, so he was immediately fired from the Mueller investigation. It’s notable that it’s perfectly fine for citizens to hold personal beliefs—there has been absolutely no evidence of bias on the job or wrongdoing. He was fired to prevent it from even being remotely possible. Robert Mueller himself is a lifelong Republican. The texts that were lost, that Trump feels are so important, are five months of sexts as part of an affair.

Obviously the press is obsessed with collusion. Where there is smoke, there is fire, and although dozens of connections between Trump’s campaign and Russia have been reported, the “fire” in question is going to be private financial information that only official investigations will be able to acquire. These things take time, as does building and prosecuting a case. Manafort has still not even been tried, for example—this is far from over.

Not only that, but Trump gets dirtier by the day. There’s a good chance the payment he reportedly gave Stormy Daniels could have been illegal. The FBI texts only matter to right-wing press that has no goal other than to vindicate Trump. Sanders and conservatives care absolutely nothing for objective truth or justice. They have no motive beyond enabling Trump and his criminal behavior.

Neale is an ally of Vice President Mike Pence and was appointed to his role in the Medicaid program in March. He was the healthcare policy director under Pence back when Pence was the governor of Indiana (their relationship goes back even further than that), and he helped design Indiana’s Medicaid expansion.

In his role as a Medicaid official in the federal government, he was a key factor in bringing about the work requirements that states are now allowed to require. With that goal accomplished, he’s now stepping down. It’s not too clear why, and no reasons have been stated, but it’s likely that he wanted a key accomplishment under his belt before leaving the raging dumpster fire that is the Trump administration.

“A year and then I’m out” has been a common mantra among high level Trump appointees—with exceptions. Some, like Stephen Miller, appear to be in it for the long haul. Others have not made it anywhere near a year. In any case, the Trump administration has bled staff at a historically high rate.

According to an internal staff memo obtained by Inside Health Policy,

‘Neale, a closely ally of Vice President Mike Pence, spent a year helping to craft the Trump administration’s new policy direction on Medicaid, and reasons for his departure remain unclear. “Next month, Brian will be leaving CMS to pursue other opportunities,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma wrote in the email to CMS staff Tuesday.’

He joins with many other high level Trump appointees who have left the administration.

A retired top general named Sami Anan, seen as the last remaining real threat to Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, was dragged out of his car in the street by armed men at about 11:00 a.m. Tuesday morning, Mahmoud Refaat, a spokesman for Anan’s campaign, told VICE News. Anan’s arrest comes just days after he announced plans to challenge el-Sisi for the presidency in a vote scheduled for March.

“There is no legal basis to arrest him,” Refaat said, calling the move politically motivated.

The cops didn’t just throw Anan in jail. They went after dozens of his campaign staff, too, and even members of their families, Refaat said.

“Yesterday 30 members of the campaign staff were arrested,” Refaat said, along with “some of their family members.” Those taken into custody are being held in an “unknown place,” he said.

Every morning, Jake Gerber goes to his local café to grab a cup of coffee on his way to work. It’s not the place where you typically find a once-in-a-lifetime love, but incredibly, the stars aligned for Jake, and something amazing happened: He made up an entire personality for the woman who serves him coffee most days, and she’s absolutely perfect for him.

If you’re not tearing up right now, you’re essentially a robot.

The connection between Jake and the detailed personality he invented whole cloth for his barista was instantaneous. After making eye contact with the barista just once, he assumed she was the kind of girl who would want to walk home in bad weather just so she could dance in the rain, which is so refreshing because Jake is looking for a woman to counterbalance his more anxious personality. And when Jake noticed that she has more than one piercing per ear, he went ahead and decided that she is totally into The National, which just so happens to be his favorite band! Whoa!

Jake’s brain could have invented any personality for his barista, but to invent one that can totally appreciate the subtlety of the back half of Trouble Will Find Me? What are the odds??

The universe must have conspired to bring Jake to that coffee shop the first time, because how else can you explain that a barista who, according to Jake’s imagination, has a working map of Westeros in her head just happened to be working there? Eerier still, one time a few weeks ago, Jake said, “It’s just one of those days,” while ordering his coffee, to which the barista replied, “Tell me about it,” and Jake interpreted that as a clear indication that she thought working for a corporate coffee shop was pretty lame but needed to pay the bills for art school, where she studies experimental painting but not the kind of experimental painting Jake thinks is stupid. Against all odds, he then managed to extrapolate from the way she smiles when she hands him his coffee that his barista enjoys a Saturday in just watching movies, would impress his dad with her ping-pong skills when she comes to visit over Thanksgiving, and totally sees the good in Jake even though he’s not great at parties and feels entitled to have his opinion constantly validated.

Seriously, how did Jake manage to project a girl who checks all the boxes onto his everyday barista? Folks, love is real!

Romantic comedies may not be realistic, but the electric connection Jake feels with the personality he’s given to the barista based off zero evidence is right out of Hollywood. And it’s truly lucky that Jake has fallen for this completely fabricated idea of a woman who has been right under his nose this whole time, because in reality, the barista is nothing like he imagines and has never thought about him even once.

It’s getting worse. Unemployment will reach 30% and prices on all types of goods in the country will rise 13,000% this year, according to new figures published Thursday by the International Monetary Fund.

If You Are Upset About Being Called Fake News, You Might Just Try Not Printing It.



CNN has arguably been the biggest source of questionable attack journalism directed at the current administration, and without argument the biggest crybaby when it comes to the administration pointing out their problems and poor reporting. Contrary to what some people may say, the press and politicians attacking each other with words is not a constitutional crisis matter of fact it’s one of the ways you know things are working properly in our little republic. The time to worry is when the politicians and the press just have nice things to say about each other. Either way, it’s the citizens that decide what’s what, what’s important and what’s fake, and if CNN want’s to make the case they are the victim they could try correcting and apologizing for false stories in a timely fashion, unlike this one.

Nearly seven months after falsely accusing President Donald Trump of getting the facts wrong on classified information that former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey leaked after he was fired, CNN still hasn’t corrected its false story on the matter. On the heels of numerous other false stories published or broadcast by the cable network, the latest failure of the network to correct false reporting raises serious questions about its commitment to accuracy. Last July, Trump blasted Comey on Twitter for leaking classified information. “James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!” CNN’s Jake Tapper, however, took issue with Trump’s statement, and wrote the following lede and supporting paragraphs in a CNN story accusing the president of peddling false information about the nature of the information leaked by James Comey after he was fired by the president: As it turns out, however, the information leaked by Comey was classified, and the records in his possession were clearly government records which Comey was not authorized to possess or distribute. How do we know the information was classified? Because the FBI itself told Congress as much. In fact, the information leaked by Comey was so sensitive that members of Congress were not even allowed to read the memos he wrote outside of a Special Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, a highly secure room or area designed to prevent classified information consumed within from being improperly distributed. —The Federalist

Jake Tapper not understanding our nations rather involved rules for classification of government documents is understandable. CNN complaining it gets unfairly labeled fake news when it won’t fix the story well that’s at best whiny and it does raise the question why are they willing to keep this out there ?

“Feminist Science”, If That Reads Wrong To You Pat Yourself On The Back



Well I hope they will be purging that horrible misogynist Sodium soon. He has been getting free pass forever, same with his buddy Hydrogen and maybe Helium will get some of the credit she so rightly deserves.

Sorry hard to write seriously about people trying attach our petty squabbles to things that aren’t even aware we exist. Unfortunately that’s just what is happening at UC Santa Cruz

Of course science is now under siege by SJWs, because that’s what they do. For example, see the event being held at UC Santa Cruz titled “Research Justice 101: Tools for Feminist Science.” Yes, “feminist science.” The event description reads: Participants will be challenged to apply principles and practices of justice to their own work, interrogating questions such as: Who benefits? Who is harmed? Who is most vulnerable? … And ultimately, who do we do science for, and why? The workshop will conclude with practical skills and resources for participants to push their research communities to be more inclusive, equitable and attentive to social justice. The event is being organized by an Los Angeles-based group titled — sigh — “Free Radicals.” According to The College Fix: The mission of the Free Radicals is to enact political and social change by advocating scientists “think through the hidden assumptions in their methodological approaches and challenges researchers to think more deeply about the political implications of their work,” its website states. Got that? They want scientists to only undertake studies and only publish conclusions that will support a radical feminist worldview. –PJMedia

I can only hope the people promoting this will one day be treated by doctors who were fully indoctrinated in the precepts and with drugs that were made by people who were more worried about political correctness than efficacy.

He’s Not Just Grumpy He Has A Lawyer.



If you thought Grumpy Cat was just another cute feline, think again.

A cat made famous online because of its permanent scowl has been awarded $710,000 (£500,000) in a copyright case by a California federal court. Grumpy Cat Limited sued the owners of US coffee company Grenade for exceeding an agreement over the cat’s image. The company only had rights to use the cat to sell its “Grumppuccino” iced drink, but sold other Grumpy products. The cat, real name Tardar Sauce, went viral in 2012 after photographs of her sour expression emerged online. Originally posted on the social website Reddit by the brother of the cat’s owner, Tabatha Bundesen, the image of the cat quickly spread as a meme with funny text captions. In 2013 Grenade Beverage, owned by father and son Nick and Paul Sandford, struck a $150,000 deal to market iced coffee beverages with the cat’s scowl on its packaging. But in 2015 Grumpy Cat Limited sued them for breaching that contract. A court filing claimed they had exceeded the deal by selling roasted coffee and Grumppucino T-shirts, which Grumpy Cat said “blatantly infringed” their copyrights and trademarks. –BBC

Apparently claws weren’t enough and Grumpy upgraded to lawyers.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Let’s be honest: This is pretty much all of Fox News’ commentary portion now, since the network became Trump Pravda.

Commentator and The Weekly Standard founder, Bill Kristol, sat for an interview with CNBC that was released on Thursday. Among various topics, he noted how Tucker Carlson, a Fox News superstar, has changed since he began with The Weekly Standard.

Speaking of Carlson’s Fox News show:

“I mean, it is close now to racism, white — I mean, I don’t know if it’s racism exactly — but ethnonationalism of some kind, let’s call it. A combination of dumbing down, as you said earlier, and stirring people’s emotions in a very unhealthy way,” Kristol told CNBC’s John Harwood in the interview published on Thursday.

Carlson has been getting a bit of attention lately from some who are seeing exactly what Kristol is talking about.

No, Carlson isn’t dipping to the level of Sean Hannity, or other conspiracy-pushing MAGAdooks, but some of his work has a toe on the line.

Kristol went on to praise Carlson’s early work.

“Tucker Carlson was a great young reporter. He was one of the most gifted 24-year-olds I’ve seen in the 20 years that I edited the magazine. His copy was sort of perfect at age 24,” Kristol said. “He had always a little touch of Pat Buchananism, I would say, paleo-conservativism.”

Compare that to what he’s devolved to, while working in the toxic, propaganda atmosphere of Fox News.

Carlson recently questioned the widespread outrage over Trump’s reported comments referring to African nations as “sh*thole countries.” “So, if you say Norway is a better place to live and Haiti is kind of a hole, well anyone who’s been to those countries or has lived in them would agree. But we’re jumping up and down, ‘Oh, you can’t say that.’ Why can’t you say that?” Carlson asked.

Because Trump’s comments weren’t that simple. He wrapped up the people in the comment when he asked why we couldn’t get more immigrants from Norway. He didn’t ask which place was nicer to visit.

When Trump made the comment, he did so to appeal to a base that is packed full of alt-right, white nationalists, anti-Semites, and neo-Nazis (not all, but far too many to just ignore). Reports are that he called associates and said he thought the comments would appeal to his base. So yes, even though some have played the blind, deaf, and dumb case of, “I don’t recall,” it’s clear he said it.

And it was wrong.

Kristol is right to point out what is happening over at Fox News, as well as to call out those that are falling into the alt-right line of scumbaggery.

This isn’t something that we should allow any national news network to make mainstream.

And because in the process of this learning curve Penguin Books came on board in a massive way that target has been massively reduced. Half way there. Hoping to push through to funding to see a copy of The Lost Words brought to every school in Scotland.

To celebrate I want to auction this absolutely unique proof of the silk otter scarf, produced by Beckford Silk for Compton Verney. (It’s printed on paper, not silk. There may still be scarves for sale at Compton Verney. You could wrap yourself in otters.)

A post shared by Jackie Morris (@jackiemorrisartist) on Jan 25, 2018 at 6:45am PST

Anyway, this is a big piece of work that repeats three times the double page spread of tumbling otters from The Lost Words.

The image is 33 cms high, so you can imagine how long it is. Colours are not true to the original, but it’s a curious and unusual thing. If the price gets high enough I will doodle a pencil otter or two in, and of course, sign it. It would look wonderful framed, although it is big.

To bid, please place a comment on this posting. I will close the auction on 5th Feb, not sure what time. Sorry if the process is a bit ramshackled. I have to action the comments, so it takes time, and I’ve so much t do at the moment. Bids should be in £ sterling, but I am happy to post anywhere in this world and you can donate from overseas. You just have to do that before 8th Feb.

If you win the auction I will ask you to donate the money directly to Jane’s amazing initiative to place a copy of The Lost Words in every primary school in Scotland.

Here are some more images of the piece.

Now, the initiative is for schools in Scotland, but there are some who would like to roll this out into the whole country. In Scotland, by coincidence, there are otters on the ten pound note. Two otters curling in play. I tried to find the name of the artist who drew the otters and found a whole back story about what is the most beautiful bank note I have seen. So many artists and crafts people worked on these notes, under the leadership of The Nile Team. Such attention to detail, even the tweed pattern is called the Dog Otter Tooth. Wild money. Why not use it to rewild the language of children.

And the Scottish note has poetry and hidden lost words that are only visible under uv light. The first lines are clear,

The cork that can’t be travels –

Nose of a dog otter.

The second two become visible only under uv light.

It’s piped at, screamed at, sworn at

By an elegant oystercatcher.

Poetry against forgery.

So please, bid generously. Leave your bid in the comments below, but be sure to read first. All bids have to be actioned by me, so sometimes there are cross overs.

Otters are amongst my favourite animals, and both Robert and I were delighted to find ourselves on the shortlist for the Nations favourite Nature Book. I was especially pleased to be there alongside Tarka.

Please share. And do have a look at the links to the otter’s story on the notes. It’s fascinating.

Bidding starts at £100.

Desdemona Despair

By Lindsey Bever, Sarah Kaplan, and Abby Ohlheiser

25 January 2018 (The Washington Post) – Alexa, what time is the apocalypse? Ulp. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock a notch closer to the end of humanity Thursday, moving it ahead by 30 seconds after what the organization called a “grim assessment” of the state of geopolitical affairs. “As of today,” Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told reporters, “it is two minutes to midnight.” In moving the clock 30 seconds closer to the hour of the apocalypse, the group cited “the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.” The organization — whose board includes 15 Nobel Laureates — now believes “the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II,” Bulletin officials Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert Rosner wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by The Washington Post. “In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels.” Krauss, a theoretical physicist, and Rosner, an astrophysicist, added: “To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States.” The clock, a metaphorical measure of humankind’s proximity to global catastrophe, also advanced 30 seconds last year, to 2½ minutes to “midnight” — the closest to the apocalyptic hour it has been since 1953, after the United States tested its first thermonuclear device, followed months later by the Soviet Union’s hydrogen bomb test. Before Thursday’s announcement, experts said there was only one direction the clock could possibly move, given recent events — including North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile test and the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I think it would be very hard for the clock not​ to move forward,” Alex Wellerstein, who specializes in the history of nuclear weapons at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said in an email leading up to the announcement. “We have members of Congress, White House advisers, and even the president implying that they think war with a nuclear state is not only likely, but potentially desirable. That’s unusual and disturbing. “The question I have is: How much forward can they go?” Another 30 seconds, to be exact. [more]

The Doomsday Clock just moved: It’s now 2 minutes to ‘midnight,’ the symbolic hour of the apocalypse

By Lawrence Krauss and Robert Rosner

25 January 2018

(The Washington Post) – Days after Donald Trump took the oath of office, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset the Doomsday Clock to 2½ minutes to midnight, in part because of destabilizing comments and threats from America’s new commander in chief. One year later, we are moving the clock forward again by 30 seconds, due to the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change. The Science and Security Board for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists assesses that the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II. In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels. To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States. The failure in 2017 to secure a temporary freeze on North Korea’s nuclear development was unsurprising to observers of the downward spiral of nuclear rhetoric between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But North Korea’s developing nuclear program will reverberate not just in the Asia-Pacific, as neighboring countries review their security options, but more widely, as all countries consider the costs and benefits of the international framework of nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Global nuclear risks were compounded by U.S.-Russia relations that now feature more conflict than cooperation. The United States and Russia remained at odds, continuing military exercises along the borders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undermining the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, upgrading their nuclear arsenals and eschewing arms control negotiations. Tensions over the South China Sea have increased. Pakistan and India have continued to build ever-larger arsenals of nuclear weapons. And in the Middle East, uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the landmark Iranian nuclear deal adds to a bleak overall picture. A related danger is the rise of cyberthreats targeting national infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies and military systems. On the climate-change front, the danger may seem less immediate than risk of nuclear annihilation, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now. Global carbon dioxide emissions have not yet shown the beginnings of the sustained decline toward zero that must occur if we are to avoid ever-greater warming. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse-gas emissions to manage even the climate risk accepted in the Paris accord. So far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge. The Trump administration’s decision essentially to turn a blind eye to climate change transpired against a backdrop of a worsening climate, including exceedingly powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean and other parts of North America and extreme heat waves in Australia, South America, Asia, Europe and California. The Arctic ice cap achieved its smallest-ever winter maximum in 2017. And last week, data from 2017 demonstrated a continued trend of exceptional global warmth. We believe that the perilous world security situation described here would, in itself, justify moving the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight. But there also is a real threat posed by a fundamental breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its long-standing leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or discern between sincere U.S. pronouncements and mere rhetoric. U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been force to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from an administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals and suffering from turnover in senior leadership. Led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, the administration has failed to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability. We hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant: an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now. It is time to rewind the Doomsday Clock.

We’re as close to Doomsday today as we were during the Cold War

WASHINGTON, D.C., 25 January 2018 (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists) – Citing growing nuclear risks and unchecked climate dangers, the iconic Doomsday Clock is now 30 seconds closer to midnight, the closest to the symbolic point of annihilation that the Clock has been since 1953 at the height of the Cold War. The decision announced today to move the Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight was made by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board in consultation with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 15 Nobel Laureates. The full text of the Doomsday Clock statement is available at http://www.thebulletin.org and includes key recommendations about how to #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.

Video from the Doomsday Clock announcement at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., is available at http://clock.thebulletin.org/ and on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/BulletinOfTheAtomicScientists/. The statement explaining the resetting of the time of the Doomsday Clock notes: “In 2017, world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change, making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago—and as dangerous as it has been since World War II. The greatest risks last year arose in the nuclear realm. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region, and the United States. Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions on both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation …. On the climate change front, the danger may seem less immediate, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now …. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse gas emissions to keep climate risks manageable, and so far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge.” Fueling concerns about the potential of a nuclear holocaust are a range of U.S.-Russian military entanglements, South China Sea tensions, escalating rhetoric between Pakistan and India, and uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the Iran nuclear deal. Contributing to the risks of nuclear and non-nuclear clashes around the globe are the rise of nation-state information technology and internet-based campaigns attacking infrastructure and free elections, according to the statement. Also highlighted as an overarching global concern: The decline of U.S. leadership and a related demise of diplomacy under the Trump Administration. “… [T]here has also been a breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or understand when U.S. pronouncements are real, and when they are mere rhetoric. International diplomacy has been reduced to name-calling, giving it a surrealistic sense of unreality that makes the world security situation ever more threatening.” In January 2017, the Doomsday Clock’s minute hand edged forward by 30 seconds, to two and half minutes before midnight. For the first time, the Doomsday Clock was influenced by statements from an incoming U.S. President, Donald Trump, regarding the proliferation and the prospect of actually using nuclear weapons, as well as statements made in opposition to U.S. commitments regarding climate change. Rachel Bronson, president and CEO, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said: “Because of the extraordinary danger of the current moment, the Science and Security Board today moves the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock 30 seconds closer to catastrophe. It is now two minutes to midnight­­­­—the closest the Clock has ever been to Doomsday, and as close as it was in 1953, at the height of the Cold War.” Lawrence Krauss, director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, Foundation Professor at School of Earth and Space Exploration and Physics Department, Arizona State University, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Board of Sponsors, said: “The current, extremely dangerous state of world affairs need not be permanent. The means for managing dangerous technology and reducing global-scale risk exist; indeed, many of them are well-known and within society’s reach, if leaders pay reasonable attention to preserving the long-term prospects of humanity, and if citizens demand that they do so. This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making. Humankind has invented the implements of apocalypse; so can it invent the methods of controlling and eventually eliminating them. This year, leaders and citizens of the world can move the Doomsday Clock and the world away from the metaphorical midnight of global catastrophe by taking common-sense action.” Robert Rosner, William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Chicago, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “We hope this resetting of the Clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant—as an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now: #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.” Sharon Squassoni, research professor of practice at the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy, Elliott School of International Affairs, The George Washington University, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “In the past year, U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been forced to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from a U.S. administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals, suffering from turnover in senior leadership, led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, and unable to develop, coordinate, and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management, and global stability. It has made the existing nuclear risks greater than necessary and added to their complexity.” Sivan Kartha, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute and co-leader of SEI’s Gender and Social Equity Program, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “2017 just clocked in as the hottest year on record that wasn’t boosted by an El Nino. And that matches what we’ve witnessed on the ground: the Caribbean suffered a season of historic damage from exceedingly powerful hurricanes, extreme heat waves struck across the globe, the Arctic ice cap hit its lowest winter peak on record, and the U.S. suffered devastating wildfires. And while this was happening, the Trump administration dutifully carried through on the campaign promise of derailing U.S. climate policy, putting avowed climate denialists in top cabinet positions, and announcing plans to withdraw from the Paris climate Agreement. Thankfully, this didn’t cause global cooperation to unravel, and other countries have reaffirmed their commitment to take action against climate change.” #RewindtheDoomsdayClock is a major message of the 2018 statement, with the following action steps among those recommended: U.S. President Donald Trump should refrain from provocative rhetoric regarding North Korea, recognizing the impossibility of predicting North Korean reactions. The U.S. and North Korean governments should open multiple channels of communication.

The world community should pursue, as a short-term goal, the cessation of North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests. North Korea is the only country to violate the norm against nuclear testing in 20 years.

The Trump administration should abide by the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear program unless credible evidence emerges that Iran is not complying with the agreement or Iran agrees to an alternative approach that meets U.S. national security needs.

The United States and Russia should discuss and adopt measures to prevent peacetime military incidents along the borders of NATO.

U.S. and Russian leaders should return to the negotiating table to resolve differences over the INF treaty, to seek further reductions in nuclear arms, to discuss a lowering of the alert status of the nuclear arsenals of both countries, to limit nuclear modernization programs that threaten to create a new nuclear arms race, and to ensure that new tactical or low-yield nuclear weapons are not built, and existing tactical weapons are never used on the battlefield.

U.S. citizens should demand, in all legal ways, climate action from their government. Climate change is a real and serious threat to humanity.

Governments around the world should redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they go well beyond the initial, inadequate pledges under the Paris Agreement.

The international community should establish new protocols to discourage and penalize the misuse of information technology to undermine public trust in political institutions, in the media, in science, and in the existence of objective reality itself.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Never mind transportation and power generation. We can address the global warming crisis by having the United Nations ban sandwiches:

Researchers at the University of Manchester calculated the carbon footprint of 40 different types of sandwiches – both home-made and pre-packaged – taking account how the ingredients were produced, the packaging, as well as food waste discarded at home and elsewhere in the supply chain. … Professor Adisa Azapagic, from the university’s School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, said: “Given that sandwiches are a staple of the British diet as well as their significant market share in the food sector, it is important to understand the contribution from this sector to the emissions of greenhouse gases. “For example, consuming 11.5 billion sandwiches annually in the UK generates, on average, 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 eq, equivalent to the annual use of 8.6 million cars.”

Next, the experts will issue an official report on precisely how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.

Although banning sandwiches would be ideal, eating stale sandwiches instead of fresh ones could help save the planet.

The [British Sandwich Association] estimates that extending the shelf life of sandwiches could reduce waste by more than 2,000 tonnes a year. Prof Azapagic said: “We need to change the labelling of food to increase the use-by date as these are usually quite conservative.”

So the sandwich is dried out and chewy; it won’t necessarily make you sick. Do your part for the planet and shun fresh sandwiches, until progressives acquire the political leverage to ban sandwiches altogether.

Israelis and Palestinians have always been on the cusp of all-out war, but now that Trump has declared Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it appears that both sides are ready to finally pull the trigger, both figuratively and very, very literally.

The Times of Israel reported that a joint poll published by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research (TSC), Tel Aviv University and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah showed that Palestinians and Israel are more in favor of going to war with one another than ever before, now consisting of the majority of the population.

According to the poll, support for war has almost doubled among the Palestinians, while military solutions among Israelis skyrocketed by almost 60 percent.

What’s more, The Times of Israel reports that those open to seeking peaceful solutions are down dramatically:

When asked what should happen next, just 26% percent of Palestinians chose the option of a peace deal, a staggering decline from 45% last June. Thirty-eight percent supported armed struggle, up from just 21% in the previous survey. A similar but less extreme trend was seen among Israeli Jews. Thirty-eight percent said a peace deal should be sought, down from 45% six months ago, and the percentage of supporters for a “decisive military offensive” to end the conflict increased from 12% to 19%.

All experts point to Trump’s Jerusalem declaration as the reason calls for violence have risen.

Calls for violence among Palestinian groups is nothing new, however. Terrorist organizations have been calling for violence since Trump made the Jerusalem declaration, including the leader of Hamas, who said he wanted to make Trump regret his decision.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) is encouraging marchers to make their voices heard in light of the government shutdown precipitated by Trump’s refusal to extend DACA protections to Dreamers brought into the United States as children and to sign funding for CHIP, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which expired months ago and has yet to be addressed by the president or a GOP Congress.

Marchers across the country plan to do just that.

The theme of this year’s march, Power to the Polls, focuses more on organizing than the public outrage that erupted over the election of a president accused by multiple women of sexual assault and sexual harassment, a president who promised to ban Muslims and punish women who exercise their right to make private medical decisions with their doctors. Instead of anger, the theme is power and taking it back, the result of a year’s worth of pushing back and rising to the fore for women who want a seat at the political table.

As TIME magazine’s Charlotte Adler wrote:

‘In dozens of interviews with TIME, progressive women described undergoing a metamorphosis. In 2016, they were ordinary voters. In 2017, they became activists, spurred by the bitter defeat of the first major female presidential candidate at the hands of a self-described pussy grabber. Now, in 2018, these doctors and mothers and teachers and executives are jumping into the arena and bring new energy to a Democratic Party sorely in need of fresh faces.’

The Women’s March 2018 taking place across the country is a direct response to the failed leadership of Donald Trump and his tendency to place the bigotry of his supporters over the good of a country. Voters have already begun to answer his failures with ballots, turning red states like Alabama blue and flipping seats in Congress. However, the change isn’t just taking place in federal governments, but state and local governments, as well, where Democrats – and specifically Democratic women, more specifically minority Democratic women – are showing up to run for office in greater numbers than ever before.

‘To date, 390 women are planning to run for the House of Representatives, a figure that’s higher than at any point in American history. Twenty-two of them are non-incumbent black women — for scale, there are only 18 black women in the House right now. Meanwhile, 49 women are likely to be running for the Senate, more than 68 percent higher than the number who’d announced at the same point in 2014.’

The marches will continue on Sunday, the anniversary of the protests of Trump’s inauguration. Lawmakers, celebrities, and performers will help to mark the event.

Oddly silent, the president never mentioned nor even attempted to spin the explosive revelations on Twitter. Instead he focused on spinning more evidence of the booming economy he’s created.

According to news reports, Mueller has now interviewed a key member of Trump’s inner circle, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Further interviews were conducted with former FBI Director James Comey and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. An even bigger bombshell was dropped when reports revealed that Mueller is also interested in questions around the day Trump summoned former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe to the Oval Office to ask him who he voted for in 2016. These are all massively consequential revelations, but Trump has had nothing to say about any of them.

Even more odd, not to mention heartless, is Trump’s failure to acknowledge the eleventh school shooting of 2018 (11 school shootings in 23 days) in Marshall County, Kentucky. Two were killed and several more injured, but the president has had nothing to say about the tragedy. Perhaps he believes the country no longer needs a president who acknowledges real issues as long as he can convince everyone they’re going to get rich any day now.

Twitter was not impressed with Trump’s bragging and turned his misleading tweet on its head with some statistics and news stories of their own. Read some of their best responses below:

And instead of going to a pet shop that gathers dogs from disturbing puppy mills, Benzel wanted to help a dog that had suffered in the past. So she went to her local rescue shelter and sought out a dog that had suffered animal abuse. She wanted to give the canine a second chance and shower it with the love it deserved.

Benzel fell in love with a white pit bull mix named Rocco. She knew he would be the perfect dog for her. But before she was able to adopt him, she did not get a chance to meet the dog’s previous owner. She was merely told that the dog’s previous owners had possessed him for only a few months.

Although she did not know the dog’s history, Benzel was overjoyed to show Rocco a new life with her. But as she was driving away with the dog, she knew that something was severely wrong.

Rocco was emitting a disturbing and potent odor. It smelled so bad, Benzel could not even keep driving. She pulled over to go take a closer look at Rocco. When she saw what it was, she was utterly shocked.

The pit bull mix had a long laceration on his neck that the previous owner had hidden with the dog harness. The gash was six inches deep and one and a half inches deep. And Kelly could tell by the smell that it was infected.

Instead of going home, Benzel turned around and headed straight for the animal hospital.

The vet helped Rocco. He was bandaged and given the right medicines. And he was on the road to recovery.

But his injury did not have to happen. Benzel learned that he had been forced to wear his harness all the time since he was young. The material had cut into his flesh, and his skin had grown around it. He was so neglected that harness had embedded in his skin.

Benzel refused to let her new best friend go without getting justice. She called the seller up and told them about the problem. That shady person then tried to bribe her by saying the previous owner would cover the medical expenses and that she shouldn’t worry.

But Benzel wanted justice for Rocco. After intense neglect, she knew he deserved that much. That’s when she hung up the phone and called the police.

The owners played dumb. They pretended not to have known the dog was severely injured. And they said they only used the harness to keep Rocco from running away.

The justice system smelled the lies. The previous owners were slammed with mistreatment of animals charge. And then they were forced to fork over a $1,500 fine for their horrible treatment of the dog.

Benzel and Rocco are now living happily together, and the dog’s health is back where it should be. Hats off to Benzel for seeking justice for this dog. She did the right thing.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Woman Adopts Rescue Dog, Starts Noticing Foul Smell.

In a dumpster, bystanders found a very weird-looking animal. And when they arrived at the scene to help it out, they found that it was a female bear cub that was utterly hairless after losing it all. Now that the cub, who has since been named Eve, is under the care of the Bear League rescue group, which is in Homewood, California, she is getting the care she needs to get her health back on track.

The rescue group said that female cub lost her hair because of a bad case of mange. And when she was taken in, she was rushed to emergency care for an entire week. And at the end of it, they saved her life. But if she hadn’t been taken to the Bear League rescue group, she might not have made it.

“We’ve seen this condition before, it seems to result from the cub’s mother being killed early in the season and then the very small young one tries desperately to make it on their own but goes hungry most of the time,” the Bear League said in a Facebook post. “Their immune system is therefore terribly compromised, and they succumb to mange and stunted growth.”

After Bear League helped get the bear out of the emergency state, volunteers with California Department of Fish and Wildlife arrived to transport the hairless bear cub to The Fund for Animals Wildlife Center in San Diego County.

The Bear League said:

“A couple of compassionate and dedicated wildlife volunteers drove this little girl down to the Center on the day before Christmas. Though we told them we don’t name our patients, they had decided that she deserved a name and called her ‘Eve’ – in honor of the holiday. She was being given a special gift for Christmas. She would now have a warm, safe place to heal.”

When the little bear arrived, caretakers took her in and are focusing on helping her gain weight so she can get back on the track of good health.

Rescuer workers believe the cub is about a year old. And if she regrows her hair as they expect, she will eventually be released back into the wild.

The Bear League has taken a solid interest in the hairless black bear cub. And a few days before this writing, they shared an update to their Facebook page that read:

“Our little bare-bear is doing great! She is a hearty eater and so far has not been picky at all. She is responding well to enrichment items, and so far she has adjusted well to her new environment. She will need to remain in the medical ward for now, where we can sanitize her room, and we have the ability to keep her away from inclement weather and keep her on heat during our chilly nights.”

40,50,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/people-are-getting-panic-attacks-simply-by-watching-video-of-alien-like-bug-video/,"Arachniphobia is probably one of the most prevalent phobias out there. It is a hard question to answer with hard numbers, as phobias are not easily understood by those who have yet to face all their fears. While many claim to have a fear of heights or an aversion to tight spaces, neither of these predispositions are as predominant as a fear of spiders.

But here is the thing: many people probably don’t even know they have arachniphoabia. Why is this? Because they have not yet come face-to-face with a spider that really can give them nightmares.

Let all of this change today as you face your fears and observe one of the most disgusting and scary bugs on the planet.

Footage of a South American beetle has been shared across the internet, and it has got many people more grossed out than ever before. The footage was posted by a Japanese bug enthusiast who thought it worthwhile to post the movements of this disturbing beetle. While we don’t mind observing nature in it’s natural habitat, this just takes it to a whole other level! If you though all of nature’s creatures are beautiful, you should really check this face-eating bug out to see what nature is really capable of.

The creature is known as the puppa of a Hercules beetle. It is born in the forests or the undergrowth and spends the first two years of it’s life where it should remain: out of site. It feats on rotten and dying wood for the majority of it’s first two years of life, before gathering the strength to lock itself in a cocoon and grow an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton is the outer shell of the creative that helps it develop protection and strength as it develops.

Slowly the creature grows into a larger form and emerges out of the cocoon when it is at full strength and maximum creepy-ness. In it’s full adult form it has huge pincers and can grow to over 6.7 inches!

We have the footage from the Twitter feed of Ziya Tong, a Japanese-Canadian nature journalist specializes in the most odd creatures that roam the earth.

“Woah. This is the puppa of the Hercules beetle,” he wrote. “Like something right out of Aliens. And … it moves!”

The reaction to his post was not met with resounding excitement and curiosity to say the least. One Twitter follower wrote: “Whatever it is … KILL IT WITH FIRE!”

This is a justifiable reaction to such a grotesque and powerful spider/bug. The one consolation? That most of us in the north o the equator will ever have an issue with these scuttling into our bedrooms while we sleep. They are found only in South America, where the climate is warm enough for them to live year round and find all the rotten wood they need to survive.

Even though most of us will never see this beetle in real life, we can still develop a real fear of it. Whether arachnophobia or just a fear of scary bugs – don’t spend long looking at it or you might start believing it is real!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,People Are Getting Panic Attacks Simply By Watching Video Of Alien-Like Bug ( video),Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,

Even though essential oils have been around for so long, it is only recently that the products have become super popular commercial items thanks to marketing initiatives that target interested consumers. It is almost like people did not read the small print on these bottles and make the connection that maybe the oils are harmful to pets like cats who have much weaker constitutions.

We can’t blame people for being into essential oils. Essential oils are usually naturally-derived and offer a potential cure for stress and other potential challenges. The current crop of companies on Facebook selling essential oils are making some claims that really have no basis in fact. Claims that essential oils can help you lose weight or keep your house clean are convincing a lot of people to invest in these products without realizing that it is personal drive and work ethic that will actually help them lose weight and keep a tidy house.

Two of the biggest companies are Young Living Essential Oils and DoTerra, which has recruited over 3 million sellers since it’s launch on 2008.

In any event, customers are taking to Facebook to offer their concerns after a Mom posted about how she accidentally poisoned her cat with an essential oil spray.

Sue Murray, who lives in Michigan, posted that her daughter’s cat Ernie did not take well to the spray. She was using a Eucalyptus spray she bought on Amazon in her bedroom because she read somewhere that it helped with congestion. All it seems to have done is make 16-year old Ernie feel sick.

“The first couple days I didn’t notice any symptoms with Ernie, but on the fourth day, he was lethargic, unstable on his feet and he was drooling excessively.”

It was only then that her husband looked up eucalyptus and realized it can be fatal for cats. They rushed Ernie to the vet and made sure he got the attention he needed.

“The vet gave him a shot of antibiotics and another shot of vitamins to boost him and instructions to watch him over the weekend,” according to Sue. She went on to add that “Ernie has not been himself. He is eating and drinking a little, walking a little better, has some diarrhea, but is still not out of the woods.”

Of course, it goes without saying that Sue was not informed of these risks by the company she bought from. Her post has been shared over 700,000 times and points to a general concern amongst consumers that information is lacking in the essential oils they buy.

The reaction from companies has been just as swift as the complaints brought about after Sue’s post. Many of these companies claim their products are safe to use around pets, and that it is really a rare case for an essential oil to harmful. One of the bigger companies, DoTerra, even went so far as accusing Sue of buying cheap oils!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"If You Use Essential Oils And Own A Cat, There’s A Deadly Warning You Need To Hear",Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,

""Destiny 2's"" Faction Rallies was one of the major events in the game that debuted recently. However, they did not run as smoothly as Bungie may have hoped.

Bungie was recently prompted to issue an apology to ""Destiny 2"" gamers after many of them noticed that they had received far less new weapons after winning in the Faction Rallies for Season 2. Meanwhile, other players also complained of receiving redundant loot items upon redeeming their Faction Engrams.

The game developer has since recognized these feedback from fans and explained that they had applied a new mechanism of distributing new weapons in the Faction Rallies for Season 2.

""It was not made clear beforehand that the new Season 2 weapons would be added throughout the events of the Season rather than all at once in the beginning. This was on us. No excuses,"" Bungie explained in a community forum.

In a separate statement explaining the distribution of new weapons in upcoming Faction Rallies, Bungie confirmed that each Faction would receive five new weapons which, as mentioned, would be handed out all throughout the event.

Bungie explained that the weapon rewards, called Winner's Offering, will be changed to a new type as a new Faction Rally event takes place.

The Auto Rifle Winner's Offering for the first rally has already been made available. As for the second rally, the same rule applies and Bungie added: ""Additionally, the previous Winner's offering (Auto Rifles) and an additional weapon are added to Faction Engram rewards.""

Meanwhile, the game developer promised that the third and final Faction Rally in season 2 will also call for a new weapon ""that has yet to be featured.""

""The previous Winner's Offering will be added to the Faction Engram rewards, alongside an additional weapon. This brings the total to four weapons within the Faction Engram, and a final Winner's Offering for factions to compete for over the course of the event,"" Bungie further explained.

Recently, Bungie was also criticized by ""Destiny 2"" players after they imposed a restriction in the number of chest rewards that can be claimed. The developer has since explained that this had been done to address an exploit that allowed players to harvest loots in the Lost Sector at a rate much faster than Bungie preferred.

However, Bungie agreed with players that the remedy they had applied ""is way too penalizing"" and promised to fix it in an upcoming patch.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,'Destiny 2' News: Bungie Addresses Player Complaints Around Faction Rally's Redundant Rewards,,,[''],"""Destiny 2's"" Faction Rallies was one of the major events in the game that debuted recently.

“The massacre of the mine workers in August of 2012 was actually the catalyst for the decision that NUMSA made in the following year to break away from the alliance.”

The Dawn News spoke to Phakamile Hlubi of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa about their struggle against the neoliberal government in South Africa, worker’s power and their vision of Pan African socialism.

Phakamile Hlubi:

NUMSA represents over 350,000 metal workers. We are a trade union that was born from the metal working industry but we have since 2013 expanded our scope, we now represent workers along the value chain of metal working. Its moved from the automotive industry to transportation to mining, and we are now even organizing the energy sector. So for example the power utility ESKOM has NUMSA members, NERSA -- National Energy Regulator of South Africa -- has NUMSA members. But the bottom line is that the workers we represent mostly are in the metal industry, the automotive industry, and along that value chain.

What is NUMSA’s position towards the current government and political context in South Africa?

I’ll answer your question first and then I’ll give some context. Our view of the current South African government is we have taken a very oppositionist perspective, we are opposed to the ANC -- African National Congress, ruling party in South Africa -- -led government. Up until 2013 NUMSA was an active member and an alliance partner and supporter of the ANC. This was because in the days of the liberation movement when we were still fighting the apartheid regime, all of the various formations, the trade unions, the NGOs and the popular community struggles which were all fighting against apartheid all came together in an alliance. So if you were an ANC member you were automatically a supporter of all of the trade union federations, of COSATU --Congress of South African Trade Unions -- for example. You were automatically a supporter of the UDF -- United Democratic Front. So that was the history, that was the alliance which was formed during the times of apartheid which was made up of the ANC, COSATU, SACP -- South African Communist Party -- and other organizations were all part of one umbrella organization supporting each other in alliance.

“From the early 90s, we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the ANC had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies.”

Even in 1994 when South Africa transitioned from apartheid to a democratic or a so-called democratic state, that alliance continued. The ANC government was in power but it was in power because of this alliance that it had and because of this relationship it had with the South African Communist Party and other trade unions. NUMSA was part of COSATU at that time, and of course we were then automatically part of the alliance, and we did endorse the ANC government.

However, we were opposed even though we were supporting them; politically we did not necessarily agree with the economic strategy that they were pursuing. From the early 90s, we began to vociferously oppose the fact that the ANC had made a decision to promote neoliberal capital in its macroeconomic policies. We had within the alliance expressed an extreme opposition because we felt that these economic policies in the long term would have a hugely detrimental impact on the working class in South Africa because they ultimately increased poverty and they would not attend to the problem of inequality which we inherited as a result of the apartheid system.

Apartheid in South Africa in many ways remains even today. We say that because even though it is illegal for anybody to be racist towards you, in practice our economy is racist. Our economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid, very little has changed. After the black government took over, even now 23 years later, the means of production, the ownership structure of most corporations, especially multinationals and big companies, they are all dominated by white capitalists and white capitalist companies. You have a situation where the richest people in South Africa continue to be white people, just like it was under apartheid, white people continue to live the best lives just like they did under apartheid. That’s when you realize that the battle has to be much more than just about race. If you are not dealing with the fundamentals and the fundamental structure of the economy then you’re never going to change that kind of racial imbalance that we have inherited from the apartheid and colonial systems that we had in this country.

“Our economy still is structured in terms of the way it was during the days of apartheid, very little has changed.”

Our government did not fundamentally transform, so they did not demand land, they did not nationalize the land, they did not nationalize the minerals, they did not offer free and compulsory education and health care and all of those things. They have pretty much followed and adhered to the demands of the World Bank and ratings agencies in terms of how our economy is structured. It’s allowed the dominance of white capital to continue as if apartheid did not end. Even in that time we have had, for example, the implementation of labor brokering, which has had a really negative impact on workers in South Africa, especially our members, many are finding themselves in precarious work, because of what labor brokering does. Our government now is tolling the freeways, in a system called E-tolls that commercializes the use of the roads.

It was those decisions, and ultimately Marikana, the massacre of the mine workers in August of 2012 was actually the catalyst for the decision that NUMSA made in the following year in 2013 to break away from the alliance because it then became patently clear that the government was actually an enemy.

It was not a government of the working class, it was not a government that was interested in social justice for the majority of the working class; it was a government which had in essence become a security guard if I can say to protect white corporate and white capitalist interests. I think it’s very important, I have to say that when we talk about the racism and that aspect, we are sometimes accused of being racist but we are not being racist, we are just articulating the reality. In a country where the majority of the people are African, it just doesn’t make sense that the economy should be controlled by such a small percentage of people. That is ultimately what we are fighting against. Thats why in 2013, in the Special National Congress of NUMSA their members made the decision that they would no longer support the ANC government in the alliance, they would no longer support President Jacob Zuma as president of the country especially because of the extreme levels of corruption that were emerging, and him spending millions on his own personal home, and we were now going to pursue an agenda for the working class and we were going to pursue the idea of the formation of a worker’s party, whose interests champion the interests of the working class.

“Many members of the ANC are actually communists, however, in practice their policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor.”

When NUMSA made that decision, we were then expelled from COSATU, and when you are expelled from COSATU, there are a whole load of other things that happened as a result of that. So our view of the current political dispensation is that whilst they may sound like they care about the working class, and you will hear they use the right kind of language, because they do have that liberation history, and they do have a long association of working with working class formations, many members of the ANC are actually communists, or members of the South African Communist Party. However, in practice if you look at the economic policies that have been implemented, those policies are hurtful to the working class and the poor.

As we speak right now the ANC government is proposing legislation to undermine all of the hard work and the rights that we have fought for as workers in South Africa. During apartheid, African workers had no right to organize, they were not allowed to join a union, it was illegal to unionize, and you could be severely punished for being involved in those types of activities. Now what we are finding is that they are trying to change the legislation, but its a type of oppression that is very clever. They are not oppressing you with the gun, what they have said is that from next year May, if you want to go on strike, in the middle of your strike if your strike is a very long and lengthy strike, the state has the right to approach the labor court, and stop your strike, if its having “an extremely negative impact on the economy”.

They have also proposed that we as trade unionists must ballot, and hold elections among ourselves where we allow our members to vote and say whether they want to have a strike or not. Usually in trade union culture when members want to go on strike its very simple. You have a mass meeting, workers en mass will agree with a show of hands, “Yes we all agree, we want to go on strike” or “No that’s it, we are done, its over,” but its a very sort of informal process but it is done very organically and its done in that style. Now they want us to have an election, where we must cast votes in a secret way to say yes we want to continue with the strike or no we don’t continue with the strike. By implementing a system like that you are actually in effect subverting the right to strike. The right to strike is now no longer an automatic right, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy. So they are using bureaucracy as a way to limit our right to strike.

“The right to strike is now no longer an automatic right, it is now being hampered by bureaucracy.”

How they have justified this is by Marikana. They blame the Marikana massacre on the workers, they believe that the violence that took place at that time was because the workers were violent. The workers were violent, therefore the police had to come out and shoot 34 unarmed striking workers. After Marikana, there was a platinum strike of over 6 weeks, it was one of the longest strikes ever recorded in post-apartheid South Africa. It almost destroyed the platinum industry in South Africa because workers were inspired by what they had seen in Marikana and they were also horrified by the mass murder, so they refused to back down on the demand for 12,000 rand. The demand for that wage of 12,000 rand was the catalyst and what sparked the Marikana strike. So you found that all of these miners in and around the platinum belt all started demanding the same thing, which caused a massive strike that lasted a long time, which the state couldn’t break.

Its for that reason that they have now come up with these laws, which they designed to try and limit our rights so that they can actually intervene and stop the strike when they feel like we are having too much of an impact. At NUMSA that means we are even more an enemy of the state than we were before, because as far as we are concerned this bill is an infringement on our fundamental and basic right to strike. The bill at the moment is still a bill and there are public consultations taking place so as NUMSA we have participated in the consultation, where we have rejected it, but we are also planning to take the issue to the Constitutional Court. We believe that it is a constitutional violation, that what our government is trying to achieve is actually going to remove our most basic rights, a right we did not have during apartheid and now it seems in this post-apartheid government, that right is going to be taken away by the very same “progressive” black government, because they are only interested in protecting the interests of capital and big business.

What is NUMSA’s perspective on how they see Pan African unity happening on the continent?

For us, solidarity -- whether it’s Pan African or international -- is critical. We were part of the liberation movement in the days of apartheid and it was international solidarity that played a major role in destroying the apartheid government. As Marxists and as Leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent.

That is why we have been actively supporting our Zambian comrades with the struggles that they are facing against the Lungu regime, particularly because as South Africans we were hosted by the Zambian government under apartheid and now that we see them, when we see them suffering we feel that it is our responsibility to highlight the crisis. In fact we were the first in South Africa to raise the alarm about what was going on in Zambia, because the Zambian government and the South African government are very cozy, they are very good friends. The mainstream media in South Africa is asleep when it comes to these issues. They are not very connected to what is going on in the continent, they are very focused on what is goes on in South Africa, they are very insular. When ordinary Zambians started complaining about rights abuses, a lot of people weren’t even hearing them and it was only really when NUMSA started to make a lot of noise on behalf of Zambian people that South Africans started to be aware of the oppression that was taking place through the Lungu government.

“As Marxists and as Leninists we believe in international solidarity and we believe that we have a role to play on the continent.”

We are also creating relationships with other African countries and we are doing that through the Pan African Today. Earlier in the year we hosted the Pan African Socialist Conference in Tunisia, and even my presence here in Brazil as a representative of NUMSA is part of that process. We believe that it is very important that we must build these relationships because we can see the attack against the working class, ultimately we are all fighting the same battles. We are fighting former liberation governments who because of the fact that they believe that they freed us from colonialism they can do as they please. Anywhere on the continent you have your Mugabes of Zimbabwe for example, Mugabe felt he had the right to be a dictator for 30 years because he “liberated” the people of Zimbabwe from colonialists, and we are all suffering from that. When you look at what happens in that transition, what kind of government takes place after that so called liberation takes place, its oppression through a different form, its oppression through capitalism and pursuing a neoliberal agenda.

In South Africa, that oppression has resulted in an unemployment rate of 35% and growing, where poverty levels are at 55% and growing, 55% of the entire population is living below the poverty line. Where three white men own the entire wealth of the South African economy, so we realized that it is not enough for you to fight a battle against racism, ultimately the demon here is not racism, it’s a system, a capitalist system which perpetuates inequality. So that’s why its very important for us to speak about solidarity and creating a media platform where we can have and express our ideology as members of the working class because we know that it is the socialist ideology which is truly the solution to the world’s ills.

“The capitalist agenda is to neo-colonize Zimbabwe and appropriate its labor and land.”

When the press and media of the so-called Western world adjust their depiction of a nation they had formally demonized to one worthy of cooperation we should pause for a more critical analysis.

When it comes to capitalist and white supremacist portrayals of African countries Zimbabwe is no different. It is never about the details or the context and all about the optics and the propaganda. From news outlets like Reuters and across the US and European press in general, the message is: Mugabe out -- White Farmers back in, and the poor blacks with bad teeth dance and celebrate the return of the white saviors. Irrespective of the real details behind a given story, the fact that such images are broadcast around the world is a blow against Africans/Black people at home and abroad. The media of white supremacy is a beast. Just as dangerous is the capitalist agenda at the back end maneuvering to neo-colonize Zimbabwe and appropriate its labor and land.

“It is a mischaracterization to claim that the fast track land program kicked off the violence of the land seizures in the late 1990s.”

A December 21st article in Reuters suggesting that Blacks were elated by the return of white farmer Rob Smart actually reveals something different upon closer examination. The racist spin of the article first explains that, ""Land ownership is one of Zimbabwe’s most sensitive political topics. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless."" Then it describes the 2001 fast track land redistribution program to reclaim African land by President Robert Mugabe. ""Twenty years later, Mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white-owned farms."" Erased from this account is the brutal violence that accompanied Europe’s settler colonization in Southern Africa in the late 1800s with the help of the maxim gun, as well as the horrors of the apartheid system in Rhodesia. It is also a mischaracterization to claim that the fast track land program kicked off the violence of the land seizures in the late 1990s. The truth is the program was an intervention to the violence led by African liberation war veterans who were dissatisfied with slowness in rectifying the unjust colonial allocations of land.

The Reuters story also implies that returning the farm to Smart could signify a reversing of the entire land redistribution process by the new president of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa, for the sake of the economic recovery of the country. But Rob Smart lost his farm just last June in what was apparently an illegal seizure that was not in compliance with the program implemented under Mugabe. Because the taking of this farm was so recent, and apparently did not follow an established procedure, it appears to no wider conclusions can be drawn. It’s more of a special case.

“The country’s majority population is in the rural areas that benefitted most directly from the land reform.”

Reversing the 17 year old land reforms to hand land back to whites is highly unfeasible. That process is past the point of no return. Doing so would be the easiest way to get the country to reject the new transitions in government. While the media is fond of showing images in the urban areas, particularly in the capital Harare where there has been majority opposition to ZANU PF and Mugabe, the country’s majority population is in the rural areas that benefitted most directly from the land reform.

In his December 4th inauguration speech President Mnangagwa said, “given our historical realities, we wish the rest of the world to understand and appreciate that policies and programs related to land reform were inevitable. Whilst there is a lot we may need to do by way of outcomes, the principle of repossessing our land cannot be challenged or reversed.”

When imperialism’s magicians perform sleights of hand its media is central to the distractions. Even though African land in Zimbabwe reclaimed from white settlers appears to be safe for now, the other areas where collusion with the West is acute should be of serious concern. The magician’s trick to destabilize Zimbabwe under the leadership of Mugabe was to impose measures to ruin the economy through pervasive sanctions of the US, UK, and EU then blame the outcome on Mugabe. Only folly can make anyone accept that the sanctions were a response to human rights abuses or election rigging. The West not only turns a blind eye to but aids and abets the most unspeakable human rights violations in the heart of Africa: Uganda, Rwanda, and Congo.

“The principle of repossessing our land cannot be challenged or reversed.”

Sanctions against close US and Western ally Saudi Arabia would be unthinkable, a country that holds no elections at all and sentences its citizens to be stoned to death. Furthermore the US has orchestrated the overthrow of a virtually endless list of democratically elected governments from Africa, Asia to Latin America. US hands are currently drenched in the blood of Africans in Libya.

Their goal in Zimbabwe has been the consistent one for imperialism. The strategies change to adapt to the varied conditions, historical and otherwise, of a particular country. About nine years after Zimbabwe’s 1980 independence, the country -- like many others following the collapse of the Soviet Union -- was forced into accepting loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The loans, notorious for having strings attached in the form of ESAPs (Economic Structural Adjustment Programs) that mandate various privatization and deregulation measures, had gravely adverse impacts on Zimbabweans like they do in any country.

“The US has orchestrated the overthrow of a virtually endless list of democratically elected governments from Africa, Asia to Latin America.”

So it was in the subsequent political standoff between ZANU-PF and imperialism beginning in the late 1990s and led by President Robert Mugabe that three key things happened: 1.) Zimbabwe initiated its Fast Track land reform, 2.) it enacted a law for indigenous African control of foreign companies, including mines, and 3.) done nowhere else in Africa, it jettisoned the ESAPs to re-embark on a more socialist path, as it had started with after independence. Needless to say, imperialism was not happy. Amid all of this were all manner of regime change methods that included a media propaganda campaign of misinformation, half-truths, and outright lies to demonize Zimbabwe and an aging Robert Mugabe.

Fast forward to today, following the removal of Robert Mugabe from power last November, less attention should be paid to the status of the land reform and more to the rebirth of the ESAP under the new President Emmerson Mnangagwa. And unsurprisingly the West has toned down, if not completely backed off of its condemning rhetoric. If the new leadership of Zimbabwe is maintaining the anti-imperialist disposition it had under the leadership of Mugabe, then they are also strangely allowing Western press to tell what would be blatant lies to the contrary, reporting that: ""Since his appointment, Mnangagwa has promised to rebuild relations with the West, to protect foreign investors and to hold elections.""

“Less attention should be paid to the status of the land reform and more to the rebirth of the ESAP under the new President Emmerson Mnangagwa.”

In and of itself a coup does not necessarily indicate that the action is against the people’s interest, whether the nature of the incoming government is revolutionary or neo-colonialist. Thomas Sankara, “The Upright Man and revolutionary leader of Burkina Faso, came to power through a coup. Hugo Chavez’s first attempt to power in Venezuela was via coup. The case of the Arab Pan-Africanist of the Libyan Jamahiriya, Muammar Gaddafi was the same.

As far as imperialism is concerned, however, coups are perceived as negative and referring to the power change in Zimbabwe as a coup would be problematic if it’s your guy coming in. And the U.S. certainly seems to believe or want Mnangagwa to be their guy, given ""U.S. Ambassador Harry Thomas avoided the term “coup” to describe Mugabe’s overthrow, referring to it as a “military intervention.” Thomas said Mnangagwa’s administration should be judged by its performance -- most notably whether it manages to hold credible elections next year."" Par for the course is that it really matters very little to imperialism whether or not elections set to be held in or before September 2018 are “credible,” as long as what now seems to be unfolding continues.

High level military officials are being appointed to high level civil servant roles in the government and in at least one case holding dual roles. This is the case with former head of the armed forces Constantino Chiwenga who was named vice president on December 23rd and appointed Defense Minister on December 29th, retaining control of the military.

“The U.S. certainly seems to believe or want Mnangagwa to be their guy, given that U.S. Ambassador Harry Thomas avoided the term ‘coup’ to describe Mugabe’s overthrow, referring to it as a ‘military intervention.’”

Over the last month Zimbabweans have seen moves to resurrect ESAPs like the privatizing of parastatals, the semiprivate/semipublic agencies which are meant to provide public goods like in energy, transport, communications, and agricultural sectors. Privatization of this nature is always the application of a neo-liberal rationale that judges the performance of such institutions on an economic basis. Do they turn a profit or do they operate in the black? A revolutionary or socialist rationale would put the public good or need that the institution serves first and if there is a financial burden, consider an alternative that is not privatization.

In response to questions about the January 1st dissolving of the State Procurement Board (SPB) and the establishing of the new Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe, Permanent secretary in the Office of President and Cabinet, Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said:

“There will be a new set up, which is in line with best practices world over. The decision to procure now rests with the accounting officer whereas in the old system, they used to send documents to SPB for approval. We came up with the new system following consultations with the World Bank and the African Development Bank.”

The sad truth is that the history and complexity of what happened and is now unfolding in Zimbabwe is not known nor understood by most people. Western media allow only very simplified and misleading accounts. Instead of feeling compelled to repay the West unjust debts, underdeveloped countries in Africa and around the world should remember that the wealth amassed by international financial institution like the World Bank and IMF came from the plunder and rape of their lands and forced use of their labor.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the heart of Black Africa. Millions of Congolese have been murdered, massacred, enslaved, robbed of their resources, and driven from their homes since the Berlin Conference gave the ""Congo Free State"" to Belgium's King Leopold II as his personal property in 1885.

Patrice Lumumba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's independence hero and first Prime Minister, famously wrote to his wife Pauline from captivity in 1960, shortly before his assassination: ""We are not alone. Africa, Asia, and the free and liberated peoples in every corner of the globe will ever remain at the side of the millions of Congolese who will not abandon the struggle until the day when there will be no more colonizers and no more of their mercenaries in our country."" But is anyone on the side of the Congolese now?

I spoke to Jean-Claude Maswana about the latest waves of aggression under current Congolese President Joseph Kabila. Maswana is a Congolese native and economics professor at Tsukuba University, Japan.

Ann Garrison: Professor Maswana, the Congolese never seem to get a break. On the 7th of December, Tanzanian peacekeepers who were actually trying to keep the peace in Congo’s Béni Territory were attacked. Fifteen were killed, more than 50 wounded. Then on Christmas Eve, the Ugandan Army started shelling Béni Territory from across the border and Ugandan attack aircraft crossed into Congolese air space and started dropping bombs. Is anyone on the side of the Congolese now?

Jean-Claude Maswana: The answer is no. The Congolese people have never had anyone on their side. Time to time, there have been some international organizations or NGOs pretending to be on the Congolese people’s side but their support never lasts long. In the last 20 years, since Rwanda and Uganda invaded the Congo, there have been no international institutions consistently on the Congolese people’s side. Again, my answer will be a clear “no.”

AG: Not even the Catholic Church? Isn’t it the second most powerful institution in Congo, where more than half the population are Catholic?

JCM: Not even the Catholic Church even though it is Congo’s second most powerful institution and its most powerful non-state institution. In December 2016 when the Catholic Church played a key role in the so-called December 31st Agreement between Kabila and the opposition, I didn’t feel the Catholic Church was on the side of the people. If they were, they wouldn’t have facilitated an agreement that was clearly against the country’s constitution and the people’s interests.

AG: OK, let’s step back and explain that. Kabila’s term was to have expired in December 2016, but he didn’t organize an election and he didn’t step down. Civil unrest broke out, and eventually this agreement mediated by the church was signed. What did that agreement say?

JCM: The agreement said that Kabila could stay in power so long as he organized the elections in December 2017. But back in December 2016 it was obvious that allowing Kabila to stay beyond his constitutional term limits was a huge mistake. There was abundant evidence that he would never hold those elections in December 2017. Those of us who opposed the agreement thought that was obvious, but the Catholic Church didn’t agree.

AG: But then the Catholic Church did lead this march on New Year’s Eve, right?

JCM: That could be seen as siding with the Congolese people. Nevertheless, to be honest, I don’t personally think the Church was really siding with the people as it should have then. I don’t want to be seen as too critical of the Church as they have made some efforts, and some of them were beaten by soldiers on the front lines of the New Year’s Eve march, but the objective of that march was unclear. The Church should have taken a clear stance and refused to accept anything but Kabila’s departure from power. No more compromise should have been made after he once again failed to organize elections. The objective of the march was to pressure Kabila to implement the December 31st [31,] 2016 agreement, but he had already failed to do that.

AG: The Congolese army, the president’s republican guard, and the military police are heavily armed against the unarmed population, so what could the Catholic Church possibly do but organize a nonviolent march?

JCM: A peaceful march doesn’t change the situation on the ground. It doesn’t change the balance of political or military power. The Catholic Church could bring about such a change if it stopped recognizing Kabila’s illegal and unconstitutional presidency as legitimate. This would change the political balance of power and hopefully lead the way to the negotiated creation of a transitional government until free and fair elections could be organized in a reasonable time frame.

Unfortunately, the Church isn’t even close to refusing to recognize Kabila’s legitimacy. So it’s leaving the political balance of power untouched and Kabila is happy with this outcome.

AG: That’s very interesting because you’re saying that another kind of nonviolent protest that is possible.

JCM: Yes, there are other forms of nonviolent protests that are not being implemented by the opposition or the Church.

AG: OK, at this point, it looks like the European Union, the US, all the NATO powers, and China are happy with the chaos and the mayhem. They’re not disturbed enough to do anything about it. Russia doesn’t seem to be very involved. And the UN Security Council has never been willing to acknowledge Rwanda or Uganda’s presence in the Congo, which is a violation of national sovereignty that the UN Charter would oblige them to stop if they did. So it’s really up to the Congolese people, right? There are no other significant players on the global chessboard who are willing to intervene on their behalf.

JCM: Yes, that’s an accurate description of the situation as I see it. The Congolese people are alone in their struggle against Kabila. Russia, China, all the other powerful international players, support Kabila because they do have ongoing deals. There is an unspoken consensus of the powerful players for leaving the situation on the ground as it is. It’s unfortunate but that’s the sad fact.

AG: So everyone’s getting the resources that they want, and the Congolese people continue to be murdered and massacred without any real intervention on their behalf. MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping operation, just seems to manage the conflict at a cost of more than $1 billion annually, most of which is paid by the West. On December 7, well-armed troops wearing Congolese uniforms actually attacked Tanzanian peacekeepers who were taking their mission seriously—trying to protect the population and stop the aggressors in Béni Territory—in a clear warning that real peacekeepers would not be tolerated.

JCM: Exactly. My reading is that the very same interests behind the killing of two UN experts earlier this year were behind the attacks on the Tanzanian peacekeepers. These attacks on UN experts and peacekeepers and Kabila’s unconstitutional grip on power are both part of the same movie by the same “producer.” The UN Security Council issues toothless, knee-jerk calls for justice and democracy in response to these crimes and nothing is done. US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Halley went to see Kabila and told him he’s obliged to organize elections in December 2018—same time next year.

AG: Since you’ve told me several times now that there are no great powers willing to intervene on behalf of the Congolese, I looked back at the moment in Congo’s history when King Leopold’s enforcers were committing unspeakable atrocities to extract rubber and whatever other resources from the “Congo Free State,” which the Berlin Conference had given to him as his personal property in 1885. There was so much international outrage that Belgium finally took over, creating the Belgian Congo. That was no triumph over colonialism, but there was so much outrage about King Leopold’s brutality that the international community of the time finally reacted. Is anything like that conceivable now?

JCM: I don’t think so because the context is very different. Leopold II was more powerful than those who gave him the ownership of the “Congo Free State.” Unlike King Leopold the owner, Kabila has been given an assignment. International interests have decided to outsource Congolese resource extraction to him, and he is in turn allowed to grab his own share of the nation’s wealth. Kabila acts as the head of the local affiliate in a much larger multinational enterprise. So far as its executives are concerned, he and MONUSCO are both doing a great job, fulfilling their de facto mandate. Never mind what they say out loud in the UN Security Council, on UN Web TV, or through UN News. This multinational enterprise has consistently been at Kabila’s side ever since he took power on January 17, 2001, the day after his adoptive father’s assassination.

AG: So, basically, Leopold really did own and control the Congo Free State as an individual, as a king, but Kabila’s just an apparatchik.

JCM: Yes, exactly.

AG: OK, so any real outrage would have to go beyond the apparatchik to the multinational enterprise, and that’s unlikely.

JCM: Yes, exactly.

AG: Early on you explained that the only real agency on behalf of the Congolese people is in the hands of the Congolese people, who would themselves have to stop recognizing Kabila as the rightful president. Is there anything that those of us in other parts of the world who are horrified by what continues to go on there can do to support them, even if we’re far from the centers of power.

JCM: First, just continue to do what you’ve been doing: spreading information and raising the awareness of US citizens. The end goal could be to make the DRC tragedy an issue at some electoral level. Next, join and support the networks of those fighting the killing machine in DRC. Also, bring some international and different perspectives to the conflict to help us, the DRC people, expand our understanding of the tragedy. Most of the time, the most vulnerable and victimized in the DRC tragedy have a limited or incorrect understanding of who is really behind it, especially of who is behind it from outside the DRC.

AG: The information question reminded me of something. Just before the peaceful march on New Year’s Eve, Kabila had the Internet and SMS messaging switched off. Has that been restored?

JCM: Yes, the SMS and Internet is back, but even so, the control is in place. The monitoring system is in place; they have the technology, provided by some companies that I’m not going to name here. They have the technology in place and they’re monitoring everything and, from time to time, randomly checking people’s smart phones or other devices, or forcing people to open up their Facebook or Whatsapp accounts, for example.

AG: High tech surveillance in a nation where less than 10% of the population have electricity at home but as many as 23% may own cell phones.

JCM: Yes.

AG: To be continued

The monetary aid was denied to the Pakistan government in response to its ineffective action against terrorists and militants on its soil.

The Hindustan Times The Trump administration on Friday announced the United States will deny Pakistan military aid amounting to $255 million as it expects Islamabad to take decisive action “against terrorists and militants on its soil”.

“The President has made clear that the United States expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil, and that Pakistan’s actions in support of the South Asia Strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship, including future security assistance.

“The Administration continues to review Pakistan’s level of cooperation.”

The statement reflected and sealed the administration’s complete disillusionment with Pakistan, which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by President Donald Trump personally and leading members of his cabinet, such as secretaries James Mattis and Rex Tillerson.

INN Palestinians condemned as blackmail on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to withhold future aid payments over what he called the Palestinians’ unwillingness to talk peace with Israel.

Trump said the US pays the Palestinians “HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel … with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?”

The amount frozen is one-third of the annual funding the United States provides the organization, according to the report. The US is UNRWA’s single largest donor — it donated $368 million to the agency in 2016 alone — and a withdrawal of US support could deal a significant blow to its operations.

The three diplomats, who asked to remain anonymous because of the political sensitivity of the issue, told Channel 10 the grant had been frozen until the end of the reexamination of U.S. aid to the Palestinians, which began in recent days.

According to the diplomats, officials in the administration have informed UN officials in the past two days that President Donald Trump is considering cutting this amount completely and could even increase the cut to $180 million, which would be half the total U.S. funding for UNRWA.

The cutting in the UN funding to UNRWA is a U.S. sanction against the organization, which has come under strong criticized from both the United States and Israel, as well as against the Palestinian Arabs, in an attempt to pressure them to renew peace talks with Israel.

News of the freezing of the grant came as a meeting took place in the White House discussing the cutting of aid to the Palestinian Authority and to UNRWA.

The meeting followed Trump’s tweets earlier this week in which he expressed doubt over the usefulness of American aid to the Palestinians, given their refusal to resume peace talks with Israel.

The United States is the largest single donor to UNRWA, providing approximately a fourth of the organization’s budget.

For years, UNRWA has been a target for criticism in light of Hamas’s activity in its educational institutions and the use of its facilities by Palestinian Arab terrorist organizations in Gaza.

UNRWA was documented storing Hamas rockets and weapons “designed to kill Israeli citizens” in its schools, a fact which the UNRWA chief admitted himself.

In addition, the organization has actively taken part in inciting anti-Semitic violence

There are 56 Muslim countries, many of them super wealthy, oil-rich Arab Gulf states, that can more than make up for what America no longer contributes. (video below)

“For oppressed nations and peoples of the world, the U.S. white supremacist, colonial/capitalist patriarchy is and remains the principle contradiction.”

Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stated the obvious: The United States was the greatest purveyor of violence in the world. He also said the public allowing this violence would lead to a kind of national spiritual death that would continue to make the U.S. state a danger to the world.

That spiritual death has not quite happened completely. Yet accepting the “inevitability” of violence and the necessity for waging war is now more deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness of individuals in the United States than it was 50 years ago when King warned of the deep malady of U.S. society. For most of the 21st century, the United States has been at war. Culturally, mass shootings, the wars on drugs and terror, violence and war as entertainment, livestreamed videos of horrendous police-executed murders as well as of a head of state being sodomized with a knife have resulted in what Henry Giroux refers to as a “culture of cruelty.

But the very fact that the authorities need to lie to the people with fairy tales of the “responsibility to protect” in order to give moral coverage for the waging of war is an acknowledgement that they understand that there is enough humanity left with the public that it would reject U.S. warmongering if it was only seen as advancing narrow national interests.

It is this remaining moral core—and the objective interests of the clear majority of the people to be in opposition to war—that provides the foundation for reviving the modern anti-war movement.

“The authorities need to lie to the people with fairy tales of the ‘responsibility to protect’ in order to give moral coverage for the waging of war.”

Baltimore was the site of the rebellion in response to Freddie Gray’s murder by the domestic military we refer to as “the police.” There, a couple of hundred activists convened January 12 to kick off a new campaign to close all U.S. foreign bases. This gathering is the result of a new coalition of forces—both old and new—to revive the U.S. anti-war movement. This conference comes on the heels of another meeting that took place just a few months ago in Washington, D.C., where some of the same forces came together to kick-off a campaign to “divest from the war machine.”

Strategically these efforts are designed to be the first steps toward building the confidence, institutional strength and programmatic focus of a new, reinvigorated, broad-based, anti-war, pro-peace and anti-imperialist movement in the United States. We are opposing the warmongering both corporate political parties have normalized.

The difficulties and challenges of this endeavor are not lost on the various organizations, networks and coalitions that are part of these efforts. We all recognize that there are no shortcuts to the delicate reconstructing of our existing forces and the challenge of expanding those forces by bringing in new formations. The ideological and political differences that have surfaced among left and progressive forces around issues of war and imperialism make it more challenging.

“Our common interests with other oppressed peoples, nations and states that find themselves in the cross-hairs of U.S. imperialism demands we stand as allies.”

But the imperative of expressing solidarity with the victims of U.S. warmongering must take precedence over our differences and should serve as a basis for building political unity.

Solidarity, however, is not enough for those of us in the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP). We recognize its importance as a baseline principle for (re)-building a broad anti-war movement. Our common interests with other oppressed peoples, nations and states that find themselves in the cross-hairs of U.S. imperialism demands we offer more than solidarity—we must stand as allies.

Those of us building the Black Alliance for Peace understand we cannot afford the comforting myths of U.S. benevolence that attempts to conceal the naked deployment of U.S. state power in service of Western capitalist/colonialist interests. And so, we view with suspicion, if not treat with disdain, our comrades who support U.S. interventions, even when they frame that support with “leftist” justifications. For oppressed nations and peoples of the world, the U.S. white supremacist, colonial/capitalist patriarchy is and remains the principle contradiction. There must not be any nationalist sentimentality or equivocation on that position.

We saw how the anti-war opposition that emerged during the Bush years in opposition to lawless state-sanctioned violence, dissolved during the Obama administration. Liberals and major elements of the “left” objectively aligned themselves with the U.S./EU/NATO axis of domination through their silence or outright support in the name of opposing authoritarian regimes.

“Liberals and major elements of the “left” objectively aligned themselves with the U.S./EU/NATO axis of domination through their silence or outright support in the name of opposing authoritarian regimes.”

The consequence of that class collaboration is the spectrum of war has today become a permanent feature of policy discourse. The obscene $80 billion increase in military spending that was supported by both parties and the corporate media reflects that collaboration and the corrosive impact of almost two decades of militarism on the politics and consciousness of the public.

So, for BAP, the historic task is clear.

The people must be separated from the capitalist oligarchy and the nature of the state must be exposed. Our politics must be clear and our rhetoric devoid of liberal ambiguities. We must expose the underlying capitalist-class interests that are masked by appeals to national interests and patriotism. The anti-war movement must advance a clear understanding of the economic and class interests that are at root of imperialist strategies and great power conflicts. We must assert without equivocation the position that we can’t get rid of the scourge of war without getting rid of racism and capitalism and that the people should reject all calls to protect the national interests promoted by the ruling elites.

We must say if the rulers want war, let them fight it themselves!

“We can’t get rid of the scourge of war without getting rid of racism and capitalism.”

The anti-war and anti-imperialist position must be seen as the highest expression of internationalism and global solidarity. Activists in the United States must reject all efforts to pink-wash militarism and recognize their moral obligation—as citizens of empire—to oppose all U.S. military interventions. We must take the position that we will no longer allow chicken hawk politicians to send our sons and daughters off to other lands, where they become war criminals fighting other working-class and poor people who only want social justice, national sovereignty and self-determination for themselves.

The permanent war agenda of the capitalist dictatorship must be met with permanent opposition from the working class and all oppressed people. The people must understand the link between the racialized justifications for making war abroad with the intensification of the war being waged against Black and Brown communities in the United States.

We say to progressives that you can’t pretend that you believe “Black Lives Matter” in the United States and not be opposed to the assault on the humanity of Palestinians, of Yemenis, of the millions lost in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of the destruction of Libya and of coups in Honduras and destabilization in Venezuela.

Reject the racist 21st century version of the white man’s burden with its absurd notion of humanitarian war and the responsibility to protect and understand that the real threat to world peace is the empire that we are all a part of.

Our task is clear: the anti-war position is not an add-on. It is a fundamental moral and political obligation for the citizens of empire. The world can no longer wait.

The following is an investigative report by a long-time member of the Black community in Little Rock who has close knowledge of the history and corruption of Arkansas Baptist College. This is a story of money laundering, sweet heart land deals, grade fixing, and fraud that includes not just some despicable small-time Negroes acting like minstrels but African American and other Clinton appointees that reach to the highest levels of Big Business in Little Rock (oil, biotech, finance, department stores) who have tried to use the ABC foundation as a veil for their economic ambition as actual education is betrayed.

“Moon ah run till day ketch am.” – An African proverb

A college president throws all the books out of the library and replaces them with video games. An undergraduate is permitted to be the assistant registrar, and there is a grade fixing scandal. The executive of the dining hall orders too much food and always runs out of food; it is known she has a catering business on the side. With no endowment, and living on an austerity budget where the light and telephone bills cannot be paid, a college gets exorbitant loans to purchase land and erect buildings. The buildings are not finally paid for, but construction is done with multiple businesses affiliated with campus administrators. Land worth far less than it was paid for is purchased from members of the Board of Trustees. The college president who is fired is not the one who led the scandalous regime but the one trying to discover and clean up the mess. This is the perennial scandal at rkansas Baptist College.

In the last five years we have heard about conflicts between college presidents and boards of trustees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): FAMU, Alabama State, South Carolina State, Morgan State, Delaware State, Morehouse, and Wilberforce. What spills out into the public is a difficult environment for professional administrators to do what is normatively termed their job because of the authoritarian behavior and overreach of Board of Trustees (BOTs) at HBCUs. However, in most cases, the actual policy disputes or signs of violations of morality in public affairs never surface from these controversies.

We have not been able to understand what is happening at our HBCUs, because the elite that runs them, even when they quarrel among themselves, believe they cannot trust ordinary Black people, the teachers, campus workers, students, and neighbors, to organize themselves and lead their own community institutions. They do not “open the books,” the accounting or financial records, for public discussion so we can discern the truth for ourselves about austerity crises.

Many of us believe it is a tragedy though when our professionals who mean well cannot assist in cultivating the popular will toward a greater self-reliance. Perhaps we need to move on toward a disposition that the professional classes, as a whole, need to be abolished as the embodiment of culture and governance in our community.

Recently, the administration of Dr. Joseph L. Jones resigned or was fired at Arkansas Baptist College (ABC). Jones held his position for a little more than a year. The Board of Trustees (BOT) submits Jones was terminated for lack of transparency and loss of confidence in his leadership. Yet, a recent visit by the College’s accrediting body, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), suggests by most professional standards, Jones’s administration was performing satisfactorily. They were pleased by its honesty and accountability under the adversity of having to govern the school under an austerity budget and heightened cash monitoring in contrast to the previous administration led by Dr. Fitz Hill.

A petition on change.org signed by Horrace “Zulu” Maddox, a Little Rock community member, and over 40 others, calls for the removal of Dr. Fitz Hill, the college president preceding Dr. Jones, from the Arkansas State Board of Education. Signing this petition could be a crucial aspect of turning the tide in Little Rock. Dr. Hill was appointed by Governor Asa Hutchinson to observe the financial and educational standards of schools. Maddox made clear that despite hearsay in the community about Dr. Hill’s desire to run for mayor of Little Rock in the future, Dr. Hill was not a “success” as leader of ABC, as his cohorts in the church and business community claim.

Hill’s So-Called Kingdom Transformation

Dr. Fitz Hill was the president of ABC from 2006 to 2016. In recent times, the average president of an HBCU across the country is permitted to stay on for one to three years. One statistic suggests in the last five years, a Black college president is fired every 23 days, often by an overwhelmingly black Board of Trustees. Are Black college administrators an oppressed class of people? Probably not. But they are submitted to abuse far beyond the standard professionals in their position know at other institutions.

How could Dr. Hill, a college president the last ten years, who was thereafter appointed to lead the Arkansas Baptist College Foundation, and recently added as a member of an Emergency Management Committee of the BOT, be permitted to oversee Jones’s administration if he in fact bankrupted the College and replaced the library’s books with video games?

Under Dr. Hill’s leadership, he disregarded historical archives and threw all the books out of the college library, though some were damaged, and replaced them with video games. He permitted an assistant registrar to be an undergraduate who fixed and falsified grades. Dr. Hill also bankrupted the college by taking exorbitant loans, including a $30 million HBCU debt consolidation loan. It is a federal felony to attain these loans by falsifying information. Given the lack of financial viability of the institution, what lengths did Hill go to attain the loan, and what was the interest of the lenders given ABC had no endowment or assets? This gives us some indication of Hill’s wisdom as an educator and the BOT’s capacity to ethically oversee education for Black people.

The BOT, presently led by Dr. Kenneth Harris and Bill Walker, widely known in Little Rock for financial impropriety as a former public servant, have put it out in public that Dr. Jones’s administration was terminated when it was revealed they did not pay withholding taxes for a few months. If this is true, research shows that for a far longer period Dr. Hill’s administration in the past did not pay these same taxes, and Harris was on the ABC BOT then as well.

Further, the BOT acknowledges that Dr. Hill currently presides over an ABC non-profit foundation that does not have a 501c3 status, as the Maddox petition highlighted. Dr. Harris erroneously explains there has been a delay in registering their foundation because of a shifting approach of the BOT to the engagement of new market tax credits. While a change in focus of said foundation may be the case, that does not prevent foundation officials from filing the appropriate paperwork to keep the federal non-profit status current. We need to understand what is behind the BOT’s concern with new market tax credits and not properly registering the college’s fundraising arm. Apparently, the BOT enables excessive financial and other mismanagement of some people while quarreling with others whose mistakes are minimal in comparison.

The lapsing of ABC non-profit foundation 501c3 status dates back to 2013, three years before Dr. Hill steps down as the president. And the suspected creation of a new shadowy foundation points to a trail of abuses that lead to criminal ties with Big Business in Little Rock. Evidence suggests that another non-profit foundation was being created by Dr. Hill and his friends as early as 2015. The terms of Dr. Jones’s employment beginning in 2016 included that Dr. Hill would assume the role of President of the ABC Foundation and be primarily responsible for fundraising to pay back the $30 million debt consolidation loan taken out by Hill in 2014. Yet as of December 2017, Dr. Harris, the chairman of the BOT, acknowledges that the college foundation has no legal status as mentioned previously, though Harris has been part of BOT meetings where it has been noted that the foundation exists - with prominent members on its Board - and this group was approved by the college BOT in the last meeting before Dr. Jones was hired.

Big Donors and “Divine Dollars”

Hill’s President’s Decade Report, Kingdom Transformation: A Decade of Service and Divine Moments in the Midst of Challenges, lists the following “big donors”:

First Security Bank – New Market Tax Credits (John Rutledge)

Scott Ford

Bear State Foundation

Massey Family Charitable Foundation, Inc (Rick Massey)

Coulson Foundation (Mike and Beth Coulson)

Stephen’s Inc. (Warren Stephens)

Griffith Group LLC/Baton Rouge Foundation (Barry and Andrea Griffith)

Carl and Witt Stephens Charitable Foundation

WIN Rockefeller Foundation

Dillards Inc. (William Dillard Inc.)

These big names in department stores, biotech, oil, and finance leave out various smaller “divine dollar” donations from Baptist church affiliated groups and individual citizens.

Dr. Harris, in a recent public statement, explains that there has been a transition in how the BOT sees the uses of a non-profit foundation. Harris acknowledges that ABC previously conceived of their foundation as facilitating “new market tax credits.”

“New Market Tax Credits” and “Empowerment Zones”

Experienced observers understand these tax credits are consistent with what used to be called “empowerment zones.” Such were never meant to be empowering to the Black working class and unemployed. But hustlers such as Hill, whose brand, was the aspiration to “put the neighbor back in the ‘hood” latched onto them.

Hill grew up as Jim Crow was coming to a close. But rather than dream of fighting the Klan and police, he chose instead to identify with the grocery store owner, with the captive market under segregation, as the embodiment of Black autonomy and unity in the community. Hill speaks in a way that romaticizes Jim Crow, of the need to promote Black business, corporate reinvestment, and overcoming government neglect around the historic community that houses ABC and Philander Smith College, another small HBCU a few blocks down the way.

Either people like Hill are very smart or very stupid. Corner grocery store owners are not multi-national corporations, Big Businesses are not Black businesses. Government intervention in our communities to promote capital accumulation is not Black people forming their own government or finding their self-reliance. Hill and the BOT represent a backward traditional notion which holds that Black individual private accumulation of wealth is somehow a cooperative project.

The promotion of “new market tax credits” or “empowerment zones” creates incentives for private capital to invest in decaying low income neighborhoods so they might reinvigorate their business districts and raise real estate values. This paves the way for the state, major capitalists, and Negroes of the Uncle Ruckus variety to collude and cash in.

The African Bean Company and other Mysterious Entities

In February 2014, Hill’s administration responded to the HLC (and their hired special investigators EGP led by Jo Spencer) who were seeking “missing” financial records from 2010-2015. Multiple anonymous complaints to the HLC flagged that monies collected by the ABC foundation did not go toward the college’s development.

A cluster of overlapping companies was investigated that had some relationship with the ABC Foundation before 2013 when its paperwork began not to be kept up. These included: Buffalo Development LLC, Turner Development LLC (Robert Turner), African Bean Company (Dr. Hill’s company with the same initials as Arkansas Baptist College – good for depositing checks written to “ABC”), Billy Jones Consulting. EGP was not able to get appropriate records for these overlapping companies, payroll records, and employee job descriptions.

ABC’s college mascot is the Buffalo. Dr. Hill in no way identifies as an “African” in any honorable way. Under these organizational premises while Arkansas Baptist College could not pay its light bills, Dr. Hill and associates took out loans to build two modest buildings (one never fully paid for) and purchase large empty lots around the college. Most prominently Hill purchased an antiquated hand carwash and prominently displayed the college’s name on that lot – he has bragged this was a contribution to fighting crime and drugs!

It is notable that a prominent African American, Judge Wendell Griffin, who is critical of police brutality, supports the idea of Black Lives Matter, and whom used to be on the ABC BOT, moved that Hill be fired for criminal activities. The judge was outvoted and resigned in disgust.

What did Dr. Jones’s Administration Step Into?

Dr. Jones, it was hoped by the BOT, as a young first-time college president, would be inexperienced enough to not understand, enable, or be made the scapegoat for the long trail of abuses Hill and the BOT created before his arrival. This is not to suggest Dr. Jones did all he could to draw the line as an anti-corruption president, in the public arena, between his administration and the previous Hill regime. He actually adhered too much to normative professionalism and protocols, and this led to his demise. A reconsideration of how “professional” we wish our HBCUs to be is necessary, as many undoubtedly wish to take pride in them.

Dr. Jones, early in his administration, found many operational peculiarities that he tried to fix. He uncovered a grade fixing scandal with an undergraduate student as the Assistant Registrar. Football coaches collected ticket and concession revenues and took them to their homes as opposed to the Chief Financial Officer and/or Business Office representative immediately following the game. Overspending and inventory irregularities persisted by the executive director of the dining hall, who is known to have her own catering business, and campus security issues remained prevalent on the campus, including repeated gun and domestic violence incidences.

Dr. Jones came into conflict with the BOT regarding the mission of the school. Accusing Dr. Jones of changing the ABC mission, what the BOT really meant was Hill and the BOT actually re-branded the college as a place for “low-performing,” “low-income” pariahs to come and be “rehabilitated” i.e. a half-way of sorts for sub-standard football players. The BOT repeatedly attested that young Black men could not attain a standard liberal arts education. They dishonestly equated cultural criticism of standardized tests with the idea that young Black men cannot achieve or learn by any measure recognizable by Black History. Furthermore, Hill and the BOT were never serious about developing reading, writing, research, and public speaking. They assumed the descendants of slaves, found at HBCUs, could never express themselves vibrantly. How did Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ida B Wells, Ralph Ellison, Paul Robeson, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, and Alice Walker figure this out? Dr. Hill left Dr. Jones with a student body that he recruited in Detroit and Chicago by essentially welcoming all to “get on the bus.” The previous administration, who struggled to process financial aid forms themselves, accumulated many students who had minimal basic skills.

Dr. Jones, who grew up in Los Angeles, welcomed students who might not be prepared for college – as he initially was not. But he insisted when students come to college, they need “not only see themselves” but be exposed to peoples and cultures that are new to them. HBCUs needed to provide a sense of wonder and possibility.

Dr. Jones also tried to internationalize the education at ABC. He affiliated the college with the American Council on Education and created an international studies awareness week. He was struggling to attract faculty rooted in traditions which have deep awareness of African and Caribbean history and that questioned empire. Reportedly, some students experienced some innovative programs that allowed them to discuss comparative religion, migrant workers, the Haitian Revolution, the music of Trinidad and Jamaica, Nkrumah’s Ghana, Selassie’s Ethiopia, and the experience of Blacks in Montreal, Canada. Students were also encouraged, for the first time in years, to study abroad and consider studying foreign languages. There was also talk about getting involved in Caribbean disaster relief, which reinvigorated ABC’s few international students, and the promise of recruiting more to the campus.

Dr. Jones was not fired because he threatened a system of hustles in the dining hall, tried to rein in the patronage schemes of ABC’s losing football program, ended grade fixing or put books back in the library and tried to get Black students to study abroad and care about the African world. Dr. Jones’s real crime, was his that administration’s accounting practices were so transparent, despite having to “afro-engineer” bills left by Hill, that the masterminds behind Hill feared he would uncover how Arkansas Baptist College was seemingly being used by Arkansas politicians, Big Business, and financial elites even as they made donations that the college rarely benefited.

If such a cast of prosperous characters could have paid all the college’s debts and started a proper endowment, and they cared so much about Black education, why did they not do so?

The Shadowy Foundation that does not Exist

Arkansas Baptist College, under the BOT and Hill has perhaps more value as a pawn for money laundering and sweet heart real estate deals, than it has as one with informed students, dynamic teachers, and ethical administrators who don’t seek to enrich themselves. The shadowy non-profit college foundation, with a now 4-year long lapsed 501(c)3 status, could be central to uncovering the greatest scandals of them all.

Dr. Fitz Hill assumed the presidency of the college’s foundation at the same time of Dr. Jones’s appointment as the president of the college, September 1, 2016. Some who most likely helped Hill organize this opaque entity before Hill left his post as the college president, were former ABC Board Chair Beth Coulson of Coulson Oil, who was also a judge appointed by Bill Clinton (whose foundation is currently under scrutiny), and former BOT member Bob Childress, a prominent CPA in Little Rock, also a Clinton appointee. Anonymous sources relay that Coulson and Childress were in conversation with other figures in the foundation machination. Regina Favors, a former Blue Cross Blue Shield executive and Clinton appointee and a former chair of the ABC BOT, Barry Griffith, and Bill Dilliard III were part of this dialogue. Whit Penick, Senior VP of First Security Bank, the college’s primary capital projects and short term lender, like Favors and Griffith, was approved by the ABC BOT to be on the foundation board shrouded in mystery.

Given their professional track record and expertise, and the Board members’ fiduciary responsibility, how is it that Hill was allowed to head an entity that not only failed to maintain its tax exempt status, but it is still revoked currently? Does the college foundation that has a public track record, albeit operationally flawed, act as a front organization for another? How could donors give to a foundation with no tax-free status and receive their write-off? Are they in fact giving to another unknown entity? Were Hill and Board members reaping personal benefits in some way?

The obscuring of sources of money, either intentionally or by not tracking sources or destinations properly happened at the height of Dr. Hill’s regime, where obviously the lack of 501(c)3 status implicates not only Hill and the foundation Board, but also donors to the foundation and the College’s BOT since the Foundation Board reports to the College BOT. Also noteworthy is most anti-money laundering laws are concerned with the source of funds and the ethics of what is being financed or the destination of funds.

Dr. Hill made many land purchases in the name of the college from 2006-2016, most of which, as public records confirm, had no value corresponding to what he paid for them. All of these deals were done while the college consistently could not pay its light and phone bills. Under Hill, ABC made land deals with the Massey family which is also his primary benefactor and is thought to be a major spirit animating the invisible foundation. Richard N. Massey is the former college BOT treasurer. Another land transaction, with Right Development LLC, is the company of attorney Richard L Mays, a longtime member of ABC’s BOT, who was appointed by Bill Clinton to the Arkansas Supreme Court and has served on the Arkansas Ethics Commission. One of the largest land purchases under Hill’s tenure was from Abraham Carpenter Sr., an African American produce supplier to Wal-Mart and Kroger. A five-year loan was floated by Summit bank. Drew Harper, at the time executive vice president of Summit, was on ABC’s BOT.

Considered unethical because it is not in the best interest of the larger community of stakeholders, a sweet heart deal is one where one party in a business transaction is presented with very attractive terms and conditions. Whether we read these land purchases under Hill as “sweet” or not, clear conflicts of interest exist between Board members and the college’s president. Whomever accumulates wealth from such transactions, and knows that the college cannot pay its bills except by acquiring more debt, is acting unethically.

During the Jones administration the BOT insisted that all purchases over $5,000 would have to be approved by them. The BOT is required to keep publicly accessible minutes for all their meetings by law. Where is the documentation of the BOT’s approval of numerous land purchases at values of $10,000 to $285,000 under Dr. Hill from 2006-2016?

It has not been in the interest of the Arkansas Baptist College community to bankrupt the school through exorbitant loans supposedly to pay its debts. In reality these loans have been used to accumulate private wealth in the name of community development.

A suspenseful story to be sure, this may reveal that there is in fact, no community around our HBCUs. There are of course over-lapping spaces: church-going folks who have a common history, young people searching for their identity and future, and those who advance themselves using decaying institutions and marginal people as their capital in a climate of hearsay and gossip.

The Black elite that run our HBCUs, even when they quarrel among themselves, do not believe they can trust ordinary Black people - the teachers, campus workers, students, and neighbors - to organize themselves and lead their own community institutions. Whether stealing or not, they keep information from us that impedes community control; Black faces in high places is not Black mass-democratic power.

A dynamic self-governing community would educate themselves, with transparent information, and root out the criminals. The abolition of the professional classes, the minority that rules above us, as the embodiment of culture and government, is imperative. Those with formal education can advise. But we should probably not trust such people unless they advocate free tuition (not financial aid and debt) for all students, and unless they wish no coveted position beyond our authority and limited means.

Moreover, our HBCU students, workers, and surrounding neighborhood need to organize themselves into popular responsibility councils and assemblies. We need not be invited to “participate” by anyone but must take the initiative to take over these campuses, the land, and resources. We need to choose our policies first, based on new values different than those held by these Black elites, then organize ourselves. Only after do we choose our own leaders. We should make HBCU leaders subject to instant recall when they are found to make a mockery out of the project of Black self-reliance. This approach might clarify the scandals found at all HBCUs not just at Arkansas Baptist College.

58,73,coed.com,fake,https://coed.com/2018/01/22/college-basketball-rankings-week-12-power-standing-projections-top-25/,"Every college basketball fan knows all too well how prevalent upsets can be during any given week of this cantankerous and infinitely enjoyable sport. But this week…it was a rough time for any program that had a number next to the name of their respective academic institutions. Not only did four of the top 10 teams in the country lose this week, but three of those four supposed top tier programs lost twice! Simply put, last week was a bombshell of utter chaos and confusion as many perennial National Title contenders sustained questionable losses and will have to rebound valiantly if they have any hope of garnering a favorable seed come March Madness. While the highly anticipated tournament is still roughly two months away, this is the time where the truly great programs need to separate themselves from the overconfident pretenders that will inevitably continue to drop down the rankings into the dreaded basement of irrelevancy.

1. Villanova Wildcats

With an offense that both scores (87.9 PPG) and moves the basketball effectively (17.6 APG), the Wildcats have rarely been reliant on their average defense to help them overcome most of the opponents they have faced in the Big East. Although no team is safe at the top of the rankings, the Wildcats have been merciless when it comes to out scoring their opponents early and are not showing any signs of slowing down in that department.

2. Virginia Cavaliers

You know that story. The Cavaliers are fantastic on defense and play well enough offensively to score aggressively in transition and underneath the basket in half-court situations. If the Cavaliers can take out the highly prolific Blue Devils this week, they will have emphatically proved that a top-ranked defense is more than enough to win consistently and to potentially go far in the NCAA Tournament.

3. Purdue Boilermakers

The only bad thing you can say about the Boilermakers is that they have not played a ranked opponent since defeating Louisville earlier in the season (November 28th). With that being said, Purdue has done exactly what an elite program is supposed to do: they have almost always handily defeated the unranked opposition they have encountered. With Michigan coming into town for a revenge contest, the Boilermakers will get another opportunity to prove that they should rightfully be considered one of the best programs in the country.

4. Duke Blue Devils

During their last four games, the Duke Blue Devils have been playing well to fantastic defensively as they have held their opponents to 75 points or less during their four-game winning streak. Granted, these impressive defensive showings came against Pittsburgh twice, Wake Forest and Miami, but at least Duke has finally realized that if they can at least be average at preventing their opponents from scoring that they can be one of the best programs in the country down the stretch of the regular season.

5. Xavier Musketeers

Overcoming Seton Hall in their latest victory thanks to some impressive shooting late in the game, the Musketeers are once again vying for the top spot in the Big East. Although it would be wishful thinking for the top-ranked Wildcats to slip up anytime soon, the Musketeers have to be chomping at the bit to get revenge against the Wildcats when they face each other again on February 17th.

6. Kansas Jayhawks

Although a close call win over Baylor at home revealed some lingering issues with this programs inconsistency issues when scoring the basketball, their tenacity on the defensive end has been their saving grace in their last three wins. If the Jayhawks can get an impressive win over Oklahoma this week, they could create some much-desired separation between themselves and the rest of the Big 12.

7. Michigan State Spartans

Although it’s been a bumpy road for the Spartans in their last four games (2-2), there is not much doubt how great this team can be on offense and defense when they are firing on all cylinders (85.2 PPG, 63.7 PAPG). Considering they do not face a ranked opponent until February 10th (Purdue), the Spartans should be able to work out their inconsistency issues without suffering too much in terms of sustaining upset defeats.

8. Cincinnati Bearcats

Although the offense of the Bearcats has been anything but productive for the most part, they have actually stepped up impressively in three of their last four games (have scored 76 points or more in those affairs). Defensively, the Bearcats have been nothing short of terrific as they have not allowed an opponent to score more than 60 total points since December 21st against Cleveland State.

9. North Carolina Tar Heels

Holding three of their last four opponents to under 70 total points, the Tar Heels are beginning to establish themselves as something more than just a relentless shooting program. If the Tar Heels can consistently stifle opponents defensively while relentlessly shooting the ball at a high rate (82.7 PPG), they could quickly become one of the favorites to win it all by the end of the season.

10. West Virginia Mountaineers

Despite losing two of their last three games, the Mountaineers have remained true to their identity of playing dominant defense. However, their offense has come up short in their two recent losses to Kansas and Texas Tech, something that can be fixed fairly easily considering four of their five starters are currently averaging double-digit points per game.

11. Arizona Wildcats

Despite looking wildly inconsistent on offense and defense recently, the scrappy Wildcats have been able to play well enough on either side of the court to win tight games down the stretch. In order for the Wildcats to continue their winning ways, they will need their electric offense to step consistently if they hope to reach their potential of being considered National Title contenders (82.2 PPG).

12. Gonzaga Bulldogs

Against Saint Mary’s, the Bulldogs had a grand opportunity to assert themselves as a legitimately competitive program that could at least beat the one competitive opponent in their conference. Unfortunately for Gonzaga, they were unable to convert on enough possessions to beat a well-rounded Saint Mary’s team that will likely hold onto the top spot in the West Coast Conference until these two programs face off again in mid-February.

13. Ohio State Buckeyes

Undefeated in Big 10 Conference play (8-0), the surprising and highly competitive Buckeyes have ground out several impressive victories thanks to their now elite defense (have held six of their last seven opponents to under 70 total points). Although they may not have the dominant athletes like some of the perceived elite programs in college basketball, they have enough reliable shooters to assist a defense that is finally starting to hit its stride.

14. Auburn Tigers

Aside from a devastating loss to Alabama, the Tigers have been a program that has continued to persevere despite being hit particularly hard by the FBI probe that resulted with two of their best players being suspended indefinitely. If they can continue to play the glass this effectively while converting their extra opportunities into points (85.3 PPG, 72.4 PAPG), they could win the SEC outright by the end of the regular season.

15. Arizona State Sun Devils

While the Sun Devils are clearly trending downward, they have been the fortunate beneficiaries of some immense chaos above them while winning enough close games to keep themselves relevant in the Pac-12. Eventually, though, the Sun Devils will be in danger of dropping out of the rankings if their gifted sharpshooters continue to fail when it comes to carrying this exciting albeit one-dimensional offense.

16. Oklahoma Sooners

Even when superstar Trae Young scores 48 points in a game (see the loss to Oklahoma State), the Sooners still do not have what it takes to win against lesser opponents. Turning over the ball at an alarming rate of 14 times per game (Young contributes over five turnovers per game) while allowing 81.6 PPG, the Sooners are finally being punished for playing too loose with the basketball and are coming to the realization that you need more than an electric offense to win in a sport that is rife with parity and worthy competitors.

17. Texas Tech Red Raiders

Without question, it was a tough week for some of the top-ranked teams in the Big 12. However, the Red Raiders arguably suffered the most as they have lost three of their last four games, with their last two losses coming against opponents that are currently in the basement of the Big 12 standings (Texas, Iowa State). While their defense has played enough, it has been their progressively worsening offense that has done them in during this tough stretch (have not scored more than 75 in their last five games).

18. Wichita State Shockers

One of several top-ranked programs to lose twice last week, the once fearlessly competitive Shockers dropped back-t0-back games to unranked opponents for the first time since November 2015. While the Shockers have the prolific offense to bounce back, their lack of effort on the defensive end recently has to be rectified if they hope to reclaim the moniker of being one of the top programs in college basketball.

19. Saint Mary’s Gaels

With a thrilling win against their hated rivals in the Gonzaga Bulldogs on the road, the Gaels have firmly taken hold of the top spot in the West Coast Conference and will likely hold onto that coveted spot for the remainder of the season. Effective on both offense and defense (80.1 PPG, 65.9 PAPG), the Gaels have the discipline and personnel to become a dark horse program once the NCAA Tournament commences.

20. Tennessee Volunteers

With a 4-3 record in the SEC, the Volunteers are doing just enough to keep themselves near the top of their conference standings. Although their finicky offense is a serious concern (77.7 PPG), the Volunteers have been able to overcome their noticeable deficiencies by playing strong defense down the stretch of close games.

21. Clemson Tigers

While the unlikely success story of the Tigers has begun to become less majestic and intriguing in their last four games (2-2), they have nevertheless remained committed to grinding out tough victorious with an opportunistic defense that prides itself on preventing their opponents from making easy shots (six BPG). It may not always be pretty, but the Tigers have an established identity that has proven to be effective more often than not.

22. Michigan Wolverines

Although Michigan’s anemic offense looked particularly dreadful in a 72-52 loss to Nebraska last week, the physically imposing Wolverines were able to overcome this brutal defeat by winning their other two games last week against both Maryland and Rutgers. While the Wolverines have to establish some type of continuity as a shooting team if they hope to remain in the conversation as a Big 10 title contender (74.5 PPG), their relentless defense should be able to carry them until they can establish a more dynamic and competitive presence offensively (62.5 PAPG).

23. Kansas State Wildcats

Although the Wildcats are not particularly dominant on either offense or defense, they are a team that knows how to play the big boys of their conference extremely tough (won two of their last three games, all contests were against ranked opponents). If this team can continue to be tenacious when it comes to forcing turnovers (eight SPG) they could find themselves being one of the top dogs in the incredibly competitive and deep Big 12 Conference.

24. Creighton Blue Jays

Considering how this season has transpired for the Blue Jays thus far, this program should have a place reserved in spots 23-25 of the rankings every other week. Just when it appears that the Blue Jays are going cold shooting wise and lack a sufficient defense to be competitive, they somehow manage to rally and pull off an impressive win over a conference opponent. With the Blue Jays facing the deadly Wildcats in a couple of weeks, it becomes fair to wonder if this team has the potential to become a sleeper contender if they can play great basketball consistently.

25. Rhode Island Rams

Over the past couple of weeks, the defensively scrappy Rams have been flirting with a spot in the top-25 and have sneaked their way in the rankings this week due to the immense amount of chaos above them. Currently riding a 10 game winning streak, the Rams may have just enough going for them defensively to remain highly competitive in the A-10 Conference (66.7 PAPG).

61,77,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/residents-watch-as-dozens-of-flying-foxes-dropped-dead-from-the-sky-authorities-finally-realize-why/,"Forests in southern Australia are littered with the bodies of thousands of young flying foxes after a dangerous heat wave. Sustained temperatures over 47 degrees Celsius have created a hostile environment for the local megabats, especially those younger and more vulnerable. Despite heroic efforts from volunteers, the death toll is rising. Animal welfare groups have been fighting to save the lives of the remaining afflicted creatures, treating dehydration and exhaustion with subcutaneous fluids meant to cool down and rehydrate.

A campaign entitled “Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown” has shared devastating images of the corpses in an effort to raise environmental awareness. The group frequently posts information about the species’ importance within the local ecosystem.

“Flying foxes are intelligent and remarkable,” the group says. “These unique animals help regenerate our forests and keep ecosystems healthy through pollination and seed dispersal. They don’t use sonar-like smaller, insect-eating bats; only their eyes and ears, like us. They see as well as a cat at night and are just about as smart. Flying foxes are foresters keeping the ecosystem together. If we are to keep the remnants of our forests healthy, we need the flying foxes. The two are inseparable.”

Volunteers have also been hosing down koalas to keep them hydrated.

Extreme high temperatures in three states have melted highway asphalt and sparked bushfires threatening more than just the wildlife. On Saturday, approximately four hundred houses lost electricity with over fifty fires reported. Raging fires destroyed several buildings on the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city and capital of the state of Victoria.

The World Weather Attribution team and colleagues from the University of New South Wales attribute the record-breaking heat to climate change, prompting the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to issue a Special Climate Statement. Moreover, the states of Victoria and South Australia have issued emergency weather warnings, advising rural populations to avoid exposure by seeking shelter away from the untamed blaze.

Fortunately, meteorologist predictions are able to give ample warning ahead of such conditions. Emergency management commissioner Craig Lapsley recapitulated the destructive potential of dry summer weather combined with strong winds, telling a news conference: “It’s exactly what the forecast indicated.”

Meanwhile, the battle to save the flying foxes continues. First responder Cate Ryan spoke to the press, depicting a grisly scene with piles of corpses and dying bats strewn across the ground. Pictures on social media have gained much attention, sparking conversation and further evidencing the disastrous effects of recent abnormal weather patterns.

As weather authorities maintain a watchful eye, reasonable predictions suggest similar incidents may become more frequent, with temperatures on the rise and heat records breaking every year.

Many animal welfare groups including the “Help Save the Wildlife and Bushlands in Campbelltown” campaign continue to actively seek help in maintaining and supporting local wildlife. Those interested are encouraged to help in any way possible. Images of the young, winged survivors have been circulating across various online platforms, providing hope and motivation for such extensive communal efforts.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Residents Watch As Dozens Of Flying Foxes Dropped Dead From The Sky, Authorities Finally Realize Why",Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,
62,78,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/study-results-are-finally-in-on-whether-dogs-or-cats-are-the-more-intelligent-animal/,"Most people have, at some point in their lives, debated over the comparative intelligence of canines and felines. If you’re particularly partial to one or the other, you likely have your opinion coming to the forefront of your thoughts. While many of us have personal biases resulting from preferences and experience, the scientific verdict is in, and it doesn’t look good for cat-lovers. According to the findings of a team of international researchers, dogs are quantifiably smarter than cats.

Dogs possess on average twice the amount of neurons – the brain cells responsible for information-processing – than cats. Neurons – electrically-excitable cells – process, receive, and transmit information through chemical and electrical signals. Scientists concluded dogs’ higher neuron count results in significant advantages in information processing abilities, and considering the wide gap in neuron count averages, the two species have an ensuing and marked gap in intelligence.

The study, conducted by researchers from six universities in the US, Brazil, Denmark and South Africa, has been accepted for publication in the journal Frontiers in Neuroanatomy.

Suzana Herculano-Houzel, an associate professor of psychology and biological sciences, led and conducted the research in her lab at Vanderbilt University.

While researchers comparing animal species’ intelligence had been using the more limited method of comparing brain size, “in 2005, my lab developed a very simple, fast and inexpensive method to count cells in brains and brain parts,” Herculano-Houzel said. The method requires flattened pieces of brain tissue to be homogenized in a Pyrex Tenbroeck tissue grinder and kept in solution to help to break down cell walls and release the cell nuclei.

By turning brain matter into a soup-like substance, researchers were able to count the freed-up cell nuclei under a microscope. Examining both species’ cerebral cortex – the information-processing center, for laymen – found cats’ brains to contain around 250 million neurons, while an average 15-pound mixed-breed dog’s brain contains 429 million neurons.

“It is fair to say, then, that dogs have about twice as many neurons as cats in their cerebral cortex,” Herculano-Houzel said. “And this implies that dogs have more cognitive capabilities than cats.”

Analysis of a 64-pound golden retriever yielded an even higher count of 627 million neurons, allowing for the inference that certain larger breeds of dogs may have even more pronounced processing advantages than the average two-fold difference between similarly-sized animals.

The cognitive gap may seem clear to most after receiving this information, but don’t expect cat-lovers to take this news lying down! The love for one species over the other is less rooted in science and logic, and more in personal preference, so perhaps this study does little for the general debate over the superior domestic companion. While the results of this study may be a tough break cat-lovers, at least dog-lovers now have a scientifically-proven trump-card to pull out next time a rendition of this heated debate gets underway.

Either way, if your grandma is a cat-fanatic, you may want to break the news gently to her and expect her to come back with many examples to the contrary.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Study Results Are Finally In On Whether Dogs Or Cats Are The More Intelligent Animal,Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,
63,79,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/heres-the-video-causing-people-to-gag-and-run-from-the-room-are-you-brave-enough-to-watch-it/,"When the staff at the Australian Reptile Park realized that a spider’s egg sack was ready to burst, they hurried to grab their camera and set it up to capture all the nightmarish scene. And as a result, you’ll see hundreds, if not over a thousand, baby spiders emerging from their egg sack and crawling out into the world. These spiders are deadly, and the resulting video will make put your gag reflex to the test.

Watch as the staff members of the reptile park film theses tiny, venomous, and extremely deadly funnel web spiders emerging into the world.

The park harvests funnel web spiders’ venom to produce a life-saving anti-venom in the unfortunate case when someone is bitten by a dangerous spider. To get the venom from these tiny deadly creatures, the staff members must “milk” the funnel web spiders for their venom.

To raise awareness and gross thousands of people out, the park filmed the birth of these funnel web spiders. And as you will see when you press play (and you’re going to press play because it is just too disturbing of a video to ignore), the staff member uses tweezers to rip open the spider egg sack and help the little ones out into the world.

After filming the clip, they shared it on their Facebook page where it quickly gained international attention. They wrote the following caption to accompany the video:

“Baby Funnel web spiders coming out of an egg sack is the stuff of some people’s nightmares – but we love them!”

The park loves the spiders because they collect their venom to save lives in the case of a fatal spider bite. Kane Christensen works as the Head of Spiders at the Australian Reptile Park. He spoke to the Daily Mail Australia about the funnel web spiders and their use for their venom.

“The venom is used by BioCSL, to manufacture anti-venom that saves spider bite victims,” Christensen said.

The egg-hatching video only shows the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. The park has a dozen more spider eggs ready to go.

“I’m a proud dad with all those babies,” he said.

The Australian Reptile Park is the only place in the country of Australia that supplies the venom that is needed to create anti-venom for the funnel web spiders bite.

The process can be very difficult. Male spiders do not produce venom until they are four-years-old. That means Christensen and his team have to wait a lot and breeds lots of spiders over the years.

Christensen leads his specially trained team to milk more than 150 funnel web spiders every two weeks. They need to do it that often if they hope to produce enough venom to supply enough for the anti-venom.

“Each egg would have an average of 100 spiders inside each one, but last week one gave us 175 little spiders, which was awesome.”

Since the anti-venom has been produced, no fatalities have resulted from a bite of a funnel web spider.

Christensen and his team are doing profound work and saving lives.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Here’s The Video Causing People To Gag And Run From The Room. Are You Brave Enough To Watch It,Alexander Smith,,[''],,,,
64,80,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/little-girls-reaction-to-shooting-her-first-deer-goes-viral-has-animal-activists-furious/,"In the YouTube video below, you’re going to see what can happen when you teach children how to use guns at a young age. Although this little princess is only seven-years-old, she is out hunting deer with a gun that looks to be about twice her size. And now that the video has gone viral because her reaction to killing the animal was utterly priceless, this little girl is the talk of Facebook. And the clip has been gotten more than 2.5 million hits on various video platforms.

The little girl in the video is Lilly Klapper, and she lives in North Texas. While out hunting for whitetail with her father and brother, Lilly was ready to take her first shot at a living animal. Her family trained her well during the last two years. She has done a lot of target practice and has been mentally preparing for the hunt.

But nothing could have prepared her for the THRILL of making a direct hit and taking down the deer.

The girl’s father, Cory Klapper, is a dedicated hunter. And he was the one to get the monumental moment on video.

Although the hunt happened back on November 28, Klapper finally got the footage onto Facebook only this Tuesday. And before he knew what was happening, his beloved daughter, Lilly, had become a viral sensation and the talk of the internet.

“We have a passion for the outdoors, and it was primarily intended to be for family and friends,” Klapper told FOX 4. “But now…I hope that it inspires other parents to get their children into the outdoors.”

Lilly is manning an AR-style rifle “chambered in 300 blackouts” bullets, her dad said. She is completely focused on killing the whitetail.

“Shoot the big one in the middle if you can,” her dad encourages the young girl. She listens to his advice and aims. Then she prepares to pull the trigger.

It takes two minutes before the shot presents itself, but when it does, she pulls the trigger, and everyone erupts into celebration.

“You got it, baby! You got it!” her father cheers.

The excitement takes a while to make sense to her. But when she realizes that she’s killed her first deer, her mouth hangs open and turns into a big smile.

People around the country shared their support to the hunting family.

“This is amazing!! That’s a dad teaching some life skills right there!” wrote one Facebook user. “SUCH A GREAT DAD!!!! I have never hunted and hated seeing the animals in Africa hunted and all that, but this is so awesome what you did with your daughter,” another added. “You can see how proud she is of herself!!! She is so focused and patient!! GO DAD!!!!”

One admirer added, “We have become a nation of powder puffs. Thank God for Dads like you. Am teaching my grandson to shoot. Kids need this, as it teaches responsible behavior.”

And as a great hunter once said:

“A family that hunts together stays together.”

65,81,bipartisanreport.com,clickbait,http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/24/mueller-announces-new-trump-cabinet-interview-that-has-donald-in-full-freakout/,"Tuesday brought an endless stream of new revelations in the Mueller investigation of Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice and his campaign’s alleged collusion with Russian government operatives. Witness interviews included even members of the president’s most inner circle, as well as interviews of witnesses to the acts that to even the most untrained eye appear to constitute obstruction by the president.

In the latest news of a string of witnesses to have been interviewed comes former CIA Director Mike Pompeo as well as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates.

The country watched with growing alarm as Yates testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2017, but her cooperation in the Mueller probe was kept under wraps until now. Yates was the first to sound the alarm to Donald Trump’s administration about the potential compromise they faced with Michael Flynn serving as a national security adviser.

Yates went to White House counsel Don McGahn on January 26, 2017 to warn that the Russian government had blackmail power over Flynn, yet Flynn was not fired until February 13. In the nearly three weeks between Yates’ warning and Flynn’s firings, McGahn took the allegations that Flynn may have even committed crimes seriously enough to begin researching those acts and their legal consequences.

‘The White House turned over records this fall to special counsel Robert Mueller revealing that in the very first days of the Trump presidency, Don McGahn researched federal law dealing both with lying to federal investigators and with violations of the Logan Act, a centuries-old federal law that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments, according to three people with direct knowledge of the confidential government documents.’

While it may have taken nearly three weeks for Flynn’s crimes to be addressed by the White House by firing him, it only took five days for Yates herself to be fired after warning McGahn about Flynn. All of these details are of special interest to Robert Mueller and his investigators, and Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI upon being indicted for the crime.

A second interview also provides insight into the direction of the Mueller investigation. Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was both a “peripheral witness” to the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who was pressured by Trump to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. Pompeo himself was also “leaned on by Trump” to pressure Comey to drop the investigation, making him a key witness in the probe of Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice.

‘Flynn’s tenure in the White House and his firing by Trump are among the topics Mueller’s team has been asking witnesses to discuss, and they are likely to be part of any questioning of the president. Separately, Mueller is expected to want to ask Trump about his firing of Comey. The president told NBC News last year that his decision was connected to Comey’s dogged pursuit of potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a “hoax” and a “witch-hunt.”‘

Mueller is expected to begin laying the groundwork to question the president in the coming weeks.

Goodwin writes that, during the financial crisis, the federal government bailed out banks it declared “too big to fail.” Fearing their bankruptcy might trigger economic Armageddon, the feds propped them up with taxpayer cash.

Something similar is happening now at the FBI, with the Washington wagons circling the agency to protect it from charges of corruption. This time, the appropriate tag line is “too big to believe.”

Yet each day brings credible reports suggesting there is a massive scandal involving the top ranks of America’s premier law enforcement agency. The reports, which feature talk among agents of a “secret society” and suddenly missing text messages, point to the existence both of a cabal dedicated to defeating Donald Trump in 2016 and of a plan to let Hillary Clinton skate free in the classified email probe.

If either one is true — and I believe both probably are — it would mean FBI leaders betrayed the nation by abusing their powers in a bid to pick the president.

More support for this view involves the FBI’s use of the Russian dossier on Trump that was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. It is almost certain that the FBI used the dossier to get FISA court warrants to spy on Trump associates, meaning it used the opposition research of the party in power to convince a court to let it spy on the candidate of the other party — likely without telling the court of the dossier’s political link.

Even worse, there is growing reason to believe someone in President Barack Obama’s administration turned over classified information about Trump to the Clinton campaign.

As one former federal prosecutor put it, “It doesn’t get worse than that.” That prosecutor, Joseph ­diGenova, believes Trump was correct when he claimed Obama aides wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower.

These and other elements combine to make a toxic brew that smells to high heaven, but most Americans don’t know much about it. Mainstream media coverage has been sparse and dismissive and there’s a blackout from the same Democrats obsessed with Russia, Russia, Russia.

Partisan motives aside, it’s as if a scandal of this magnitude is more than America can bear — so let’s pretend there’s nothing to see and move along.

But, thankfully the disgraceful episode won’t be washed away, thanks to a handful of congressional Republicans, led by California Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House’s Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After he accused the FBI of stonewalling in turning over records, the bureau relented, at least partially.

The result was clear evidence of bias against Trump by officials charged with investigating him and Clinton. Those same agents appear to have acted on that bias to tilt the election to Clinton.

In one text message, an agent suggests that Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew while the investigation was still going on that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton.

How could she know unless the fix was in?

All roads in the explosive developments lead to James Comey, whose Boy Scout image belied a sinister belief that he, like his infamous predecessor J. Edgar Hoover, was above the law.

It is why I named him J. Edgar Comey last year and wrote that he was “adept at using innuendo and leaks” to let everybody in Washington know they could be the next to be investigated.

It was in the office of Comey’s top deputy, Andrew McCabe, where agents discussed an “insurance policy” in the event that Trump won. Reports indicated that the Russia-collusion probe was that insurance policy.

The text was from Peter Strzok, the top investigator on the Trump case, and was sent to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and also his mistress.

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40 . . . ” Strzok wrote.

It is frightening that Strzok, who called Trump “an idiot,” was the lead investigator on both the Clinton and Trump cases.

After these messages surfaced, special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok and Page from his probe, though both still work at the FBI.

Strzok, despite his talk of an “insurance policy” in 2016, wrote in May of 2017 that he was skeptical Mueller’s probe would find anything on Trump because “there’s no big there there.”

Talk about irony. While Dems and the left-wing media already found Trump guilty of collusion before Mueller was appointed, the real scandal might be the conduct of the probers themselves.

Suspicions are hardly allayed by the fact that the FBI says it can’t find five months of messages between Strzok and Page, who exchanged an estimated 50,000 messages overall. The missing period — Dec. 14, 2016 through May 17, 2017 — was a crucial time in Washington.

There were numerous leaks of classified material just before and after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

And the president fired Comey last May 9, provoking an intense lobbying effort for a special counsel, which led to Mueller’s appointment on May 19.

Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has emerged from his hidey hole to notice that the FBI has run amok, and said Monday he would “leave no stone unturned” to find the five months of missing texts.

Fine, but the House is racing ahead of him. Nunes has prepared a four-page memo, based on classified material that purportedly lays out what the FBI and others did to corrupt the election.

A movement to release the memo is gaining steam, but Congress says it might take weeks. Why wait?

Akshuali Broke, now aged 60, says she is overjoyed with the news that she’s eligible to apply for the $888 a fortnight aged pension, instead of the $538 payments she would have received on Newstart when she started her call almost four decades ago.

“That’s more than $30 over the poverty line, so I guess you could say that spending the remainder of my youth navigating phone prompts in search of Centrelink’s five remaining staff members has finally paid off,” Ms Broke said.

While Ms Broke admits being on the phone during critical life events including her children’s births and graduations was frustrating, she says the soothing tones of Mozart’s Divertimento in F major have helped her through many of life’s trials.

“If nothing else, this experience has taught me that there’s nothing a continuous loop of one classical song and 23 years of waiting can’t fix,” she says.

When asked why she didn’t just hang up the phone and get a job, Ms Broke replied, “Oh, but the back pay! Think of the back pay!”

There are concerns, however, about whether Ms Broke will see any money within her lifetime, as the Centrelink staffer who took her call said that now she was eligible for the aged pension, she would have to dial another number to lodge a new claim.

In November , he said, “I really, genuinely do not understand Christian support for Trump” with a very slight sneer of theo-political superiority, which isn’t at all uncommon among the Bishops of the Church of England:

Breitbart Justin Welby was preaching at Canterbury cathedral at the same time as Pope Francis made oblique criticism of Trump in his traditional Christmas address in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City, (comparing Mary and Joseph to the Muslim freeloaders, rapists, and jihadists pretending to be refugees invading Europe)

The pontiff made particular reference to the situation in the Middle East just two weeks after the US president inflamed tensions in the region by controversially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In Canterbury, Welby told worshippers that much could be learnt from the nativity story, where Jesus is “power seen in humility”.

It wasn’t long ago that this Archbishop warned against developing a “culture of fear” towards Muslims in Britain and said the proportion of Muslims in Britain who are radicalized remained “extraordinarily small.” uk-dhimmi-archbishop-of-canterbury-says-there-is-too-much-hysteria-over-islamization-and-muslim-radicalization

The Bishop of Liverpool, Paul Bayes, also attacks Christians who support President Donald Trump and “a system which builds walls instead of bridges.”

Breitbart Paul Bayes, a senior figure in the Church of England, also appeared to argue that backing “rightwing populism” could be incompatible with biblical teaching. He said he regretted that “people who call themselves evangelical in the US seem to be uncritically accepting” positions taken by Trump and his allies.

His intervention comes just days after the Archbishop of Canterbury, who leads the church, used his Christmas address to target so-called “tyrannical and populist” world leaders – widely perceived as a dig at Mr. Trump.

Adding to the politicised onslaught, Mr. Bayes told the British left-wing Guardian newspaper: “Some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalises the poor, a system which builds walls instead of bridges, a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded, a system which says we’re not welcoming people any more into our country.”

Bayes (below) even slammed Trump/Brexit voters who “bow the knee to hate” by tweeting this nauseatingly fake Amazon commercial featuring a Muslim imam and a Catholic priest, trying to make you think that Muslims and Christians in real life are BFFs.

Not all the archbishops agreed with this tweet:

A 17-year study has concluded that the removal a song lyric regarding a fictional character bringing a fake gun to school in the song Teenage Dirtbag by Wheatus has, unfortunately, done nothing to end gun violence in the USA.

The lyric in question references a ‘boyfriend’ who is stated to be ‘a dick’ and ‘brings a gun to school,’ the latter lyric being edited out of the radio, TV and streaming edit as a clever way to end gun violence without actually doing anything to end gun violence.

Former president and escaped Jim Henson puppet, George W. Bush stated this finding is particularly disappointing as they were waiting for the results of this study to come back before doing anything to stop gun violence in the USA.

“If replacing a lyric about a make believe gun with a fake record scratch has not managed to stop people from getting access to guns then I’m not sure what else we can do to stop the killing of innocent Americans.”

Many Americans are upset to discover that censoring a lyric from a song featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 Jason Biggs film, Loser, did not have the groundbreaking impact on the US gun epidemic everyone was hoping for.

In the centre of this party of disappointed Americans is none other than lead singer of Wheatus, Brendan B. Brown, who hoped the censorship of his biggest hit would at least do something to decrease ease of access to firearms in America.

“At least there haven’t been as many shootings in high schools now. Sure, 13,286 Americans were killed by guns in 2015 alone, but not as many in high schools. There were way more in colleges, shopping centres, nightclubs, workplaces, cinemas and concerts than there were in high schools so let’s not treat this as a complete failure.”

One additional finding of the study suggests that lyrical content does not necessarily have a direct effect on behaviour, something lead singer of Iron Maiden, Bruce Dickinson, will happily attest to.

“We didn’t see any sort of increase in ticket sales from the release of that song. No increase of teenage dirtbags at our shows, just the usual middle-aged dirtbags who only ever wear our t-shirts.”

For citizens of the USA this comes as another critical blow to their abusive relationship with an amendment written at a point in time where someone could simply take over your farm by killing you.

A local girl has today committed an act that has become the norm amongst male and female social media users. Aliesha Handley-Smith (26) took a screenshot of Kate Simpson’s latest Instagram post and sent it directly to her all female group chat.



“Omg, Kate’s latest Insta” accompanied the photo.

The photo in question is one that see’s Kate, Instagram name keepingupwithkate, kneeling in front of a mirror with a concave arch in her spine, a technique employed by a number influencers that gives the illusion of a fuller, more peach-like butt.

“Can she get a grip?” One member replied.

“Omg what does her boyfriend think about this?” Questioned another.

“’K E E N // F O R // P E A C H’ wtf!?! I literally can’t deal” Another shot back.

One group member, who wished to remain anonymous, is referring to the caption that Kate uploaded with her photo, which The Advocate understands is a double entendre that is essentially a sexual proposition to her followers.

Sources have told The Advocate that the entire group chat have since liked Kate’s photo on Instagram and commented on it, the comments ranging from “yaass girl, [fire emoji] [peach emoji]” to “omg, slay!” some members even tagged Kate’s boyfriend.

The Advocate reached out to social media expert and behavioural psychologist, Dr. Christopher Walking, to see why this two-faced trend exists.

“Well, it’s simple really. These girls just haven’t matured yet. Another factor worth acknowledging is that the majority of these girls are Gemini’s, who are notorious for this kind of behaviour”

One stool is making double the amount he normally does for doing half the work he normally does.

The other stool is indulging himself in some mass produced sausages on high carb white bread while enjoying a few drinks of choice with his friends.

“Every year I spend the month leading up to a public holiday telling myself that it’s smart to lock myself away in the confines of employment at the hardware store I work at (Jims Bits N Bobs),” he told The Advocate today.

“And then the day rolls around. Everyone in my share house starts getting excited. They wake up in the morning and are bubbling with joy at the chance to have a free day to consume as much drugs and/or alcohol as they want, and I start to feel very sad” he said.

Brooks told us that as he gets dressed and heads out the door he starts to really feel like it would have been good to jump on the other stool.

“Just for once it would be good. I have worked the last three Aus and Anzac days for fuck sake. It would be nice to just blow out one day.”

“Once I finish this degree that’s going to in-debt me for the rest of my life and only improve my chances of career success and satisfaction marginally then I can enjoy myself on this public holidays.”

“And I guessed the time pretty bang on but no one is talking about that. I bet you don’t even report it.”

Disgruntled partygoers later determined the song West skipped was in fact DNA by Kendrick Lamar, a song the artist himself has called a gospel song, a fact that has startled the usually conservative West.

“That’s great there’s more gospel out there but do we need to have all these swear words in it? What’s wrong with a good old fashion hymn?”

Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten has today made a bold attempt at winning over youth voters by posting his very first ‘NekNominate’ video – just 46 months after the brief viral trend rose to prominence.

It is not yet known which recent Melbourne University law graduate working as an advisor and confidante of the Labor-right identity was behind the idea, but it has caused collective groans right through his own party, and Australia as a whole.

The game became popular in early 2014, and as it spread it escalated, with nominees performing the challenge in more extreme circumstances, drinking more potent beverages or engaging in dangerous activities either during or immediately after consuming their beverage.

It was three years ago when Bill Shorten was was originally neknominated by Sam Dastyari, the Labor-right darling at the time but due to his newfound position as leader of the ALP, Shorten thought all that was needed to be elected was a squeaky brand. However in the post-truth populist political climate, this is no longer the case.

“I next nominate you Penny! [hahah]” said Shorten in a monotone voice that made him sound as though he was reading quite slowly from a teleprompter.

Neknominate, also known as neck and nominate, neknomination or neck nomination, is an online drinking game. The original rules of the game require the participants to film themselves drinking a pint of an alcoholic beverage, usually beer, in one gulp and upload the footage to the web. A participant then nominates another person to do the same, which has to be done within 24 hours.

It has been reported that Shorten latched onto this idea after seeing former Prime Minister Bob Hawke managing to remain relevant at the Sydney test last week, and demanded that his staffers find him a funny and relatable way to binge drink on camera.

Before beginning his private celebration of BBQ and beverages (swordfish steak and vintage Penfolds) Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull took a chance to address to the mounting controversy of Australia Day stating it is a non-issue.

“It’s a day to recognise our history and celebrate together, just as the settlers and Indigenous Australians did when they first met on this most amazing day.”

With many citizens unconvinced by this response, Turnbull took things a step further and urged anyone with problems regarding the date of Australia Day to take it up with opposition leader Bill Shorten.

“Look, Australia Day is for all Australians no matter how our stories began. But if you disagree you should know its entirely Labor’s fault.”

Citing Australia becoming a nationwide day of celebration and eventually a public holiday during the Hawke and Keating years, Turnbull stated those against the date need to consider that Australia Day is the fault of politicians they were too young to have voted for.

“They sowed this seed back under Whitlam. It’s their fault”

Amidst some activists calling his comments discriminative, Turnbull was quick to remind them he can’t be as he has a granddaughter with Chinese heritage, something Bill Shorten certainly doesn’t have.

“Journalists” from left-wing youth publications were quick to remind Turnbull that while some fault does lie with left-leaning politicians from 25 years ago, he himself does have the power to change the date.

In a rare interview, speaking exclusively to Richard Keys and Andy Gray, Johnson said he followed the career of the player once dubbed “the new Pele” early on, but admits he eventually just lost interest.

Johnson said via Skype from HM Prison Moorland. “He ticked all the right boxes for me.”

Devoting a surprisingly large amount of his time discussing the teenage sensation’s early years, he continued discussing Adu’s debut at 12:

“In some ways he was just a kid back then but he certainly didn’t look it. I thought he was at least 14. He looked absolutely amazing, but inevitably went completely off the boil once he hit puberty,” Johnson lamented, “isn’t that always the way?”

In a wide ranging interview, the former Sunderland star also spoke of his old club’s recent fortunes and England’s chances at the World Cup, but unfortunately left no time to discuss his present conviction for child molestation.

As the interview came to a close both Keys and Gray expressed their dismay at Johnson’s current situation saying the football world has hung him “out to dry” and assured him there will be a job waiting for him with BEIN Sports in Qatar when he gets out.

Dr. Melina Abdullah, professor and chair of Pan-African Studies at California State University, recently conducted a libation ceremony inside the Hollywood United Methodist Church to summon the spiritual energy of dead civil rights leaders and other blacks who died at the hands of police officers.

Author and Christian scholar Dr. Hamilton Ayuk argued on his blog that the pouring of libation to honor any spirit other than the God of the Bible is contrary to Scripture.

Speaking at the church where advocates had gathered to discuss their opposition to a $3.5 billion jail expansion plan in Los Angeles County along with the issue of mass incarceration, Abdullah, who is one of the original organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement, argued that because the issue of mass incarceration was also a spiritual struggle, it was important to conduct the libation ritual to summon the energy of those who had died in the struggle for civil rights.

""This is not just a social justice, a racial justice, an economic justice struggle,"" Abdullah said. ""This is also a spiritual struggle, so it's appropriate that we're here in this setting (a church). And it's also important that we summon the right energy into this space no matter what faith you are. We have to understand what the struggle is about.""

She continued: ""Making sure that jails don't expand is a first step. We don't want cages at all. Our people don't belong in cages at all. And we understand that there is a direct relationship, our ancestors demand that we engage in this work because as an African person in this country we know we were brought over here as chattel and once they banned the slave plantations, many of those plantations were warped into prisons so they continue to enslave us. So this is ancestral and spiritual work that we must do. So we are going to pour libation in the names of our ancestors, in the names of those who struggle right now.""

She then proceeded to pour what appeared to be bottled water as she summoned the energy of the dead while declaring ""ashe.""

""We summon those spirits that are still with us. We summon those people whose bodies have been stolen, but whose souls are still here,"" she said. ""We call on Wakiesha Wilson. We call on George Jackson ... Eric Garner ...""

""And all of those whose bodies have been stolen: We ask that you be with us. We ask that you work through us. We ask that we do righteous work on your behalf,"" Abdullah continued inside the church.

""We call on Martin Luther King into this space. Brother Malcom [X], we call you into this space. Ashe. ... Nat Turner, into this space. Ashe. Mother Harriet Tubman. Ashe. We call you all into this space. We ask that you work through us. That you give us power; that the Creator give us power when we come together. This victory is assured. Ashe. Ashe. Ashe,"" she ended.

The practice of libation is a common practice in some African-American churches like Unity Fellowship Church of Baltimore where they conduct the ritual to ""honor the ancestors. Those who in one way or another helped us to get to where we are today.""

According to Dr. Ayuk, however, while libation can be found in the Bible it was ""done as a form of worship to God and not gods.""

Heathens, he said, ""copied the practice and when Israel strayed from God, they took the ritual to heathen gods"" and most African communities currently pour libation as a part of their tradition.

""The practice is said to have begun in Israel when Jacob intended to appease God with a drink offering and oil (Gen 35:14). Although from Genesis 1-35 there is a mirror that captured the culture of the surrounding nations, there is no indication any of them performed the ritual before this time,"" Ayuk wrote.

""Drifting away from God has nefarious consequences. Perhaps that is why most African countries entrenched in ancestral worship are backwards because they seem to invite more the wrath rather than the favor of God. From Africa to Asia, Latin America to Europe and North America to Central America, there is enough evidence that abandoning the ways of God will fetch us disaster now and hell fire in the world to come,"" Ayuk added.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Professor Conducts Libation to Summon Spirits of Blacks Killed by Police in Hollywood Church,,,[''],"Dr. Melina Abdullah, professor and chair of Pan-African Studies at California State University, recently conducted a libation ceremony inside the Hollywood United Methodist Church to summon the spiritual energy of dead civil rights leaders and other blacks who died at the hands of police officers.",,,

While news of North and South Korea agreeing to march under a ""unified Korea"" flag at the upcoming Winter Olympics has sparked hopes for peace, a grim reminder of the harshness of life in the North washed up on the shores of Japan in a ""ghost ship"" that contained eight skeletal remains.

AFP reported on Tuesday that coastguards in Japan found the decomposing corpses of seven men inside the wreckage of a ship that washed up in Kanazawa, with the remains of another man discovered 50 feet from the boat.

Senior police official Hiroshi Abe said that ""it is difficult to identify the bodies as they had begun to decompose.""

While Abe said it is yet to be confirmed that the boat came from North Korea, CNN said police also found a badge with the likenesses of North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung inside the boat, along with a cigarette box with Korean letters.

As many as 113 suspected North Korean vessels dubbed ""ghost ships"" washed up in Japan in 2017, carrying the decomposing bodies of 43 people.

The victims are believed to be mostly fishing crews driven by hunger and desperation further out into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Several North Korean defectors spoke last year about the extreme poverty and starvation gripping many citizens under Kim Jong Un's regime. Christians suffer heavily there too, and are often sent to prison camps or executed if their faith is discovered.

The discovery of this year's first ghost ship coincides with news that North and South Korea will march under the same flag for the opening of the Winter Olympic games, which will take place between Feb. 9–25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

BBC News reported that the two countries will also field a joint women's ice hockey team.

While the apparent thawing in relations means that the cross-border road between the two nations will be opened for the first time in two years, some, such as Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono, have warned against North Korea's sudden ""charm offensive.""

""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Kono said, according to Reuters.

""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working,"" he added, referring to heavy international sanctions against the North.

Just last month Kim Jong Un was still issuing grave warnings against the United States, and said during his New Year's Day speech that his country has the capability to hit U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons.

""The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat,"" Kim said.

""This year we should focus on mass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment,"" the North Korean leader added.

UPDATE 11:40 a.m. ET Jan. 18: Facebook said Thursday that it has lifted its ban on paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to Alveda King's upcoming documentary that highlights the ""real untold story"" of abortion in the United States and the history of eugenics associated with Planned Parenthood.

In an emailed statement to The Christian Post, Facebook said the pro-life ad was originally disapproved in error and was correctly approved upon appeal. At this time, all ads connected to the ""Roe v. Wade"" movie page are running.

Facebook also said that abilities of all the administrators for the page will be fully restored after being temporarily blocked for so-called ""spam behavior.""

Original report:

Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece is speaking out against Facebook's decision to ban paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to her upcoming documentary that highlights the ""real untold story"" of abortion in the United States and the history of eugenics associated with Planned Parenthood.

Alveda King, a prominent Christian conservative and pro-life activist who serves as director of civil rights for the unborn at Priests for Life, spoke with Family Research Council's Tony Perkins during a special National Religious Freedom Day broadcast of his radio show on Tuesday and explained that Facebook pulled down paid ads and is blocking shares for her upcoming film, ""Roe v, Wade.""

Named after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized elective abortions, the documentary stars Hollywood actor Jon Voight and is said to be the first movie ever to expose ""the real untold story of how people lied; how the media lied; and how the courts were manipulated to pass a law that has since killed over 60 million Americans.""

Expand | Collapse (Photo: Reuters/Mary F. Calvert) Alveda King, founder of Alveda King Ministries, speaks during an ""I Have a Dream"" Gospel brunch at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington, D.C., on August 25, 2013.

""There is a new movie coming out — 'Roe v. Wade.' I am one of the executive producers. Facebook has pulled down our ads, the paid ads and any mention of the non-paid ads,"" King said while addressing the topic of religious freedom. ""They do not want the message of the injustice of abortion broadcast and they are trying to block that.""

King is referring to Facebook's blocking of ads promoting the movie's Indiegogo crowdfunding account. Thus far, the movie has raised just under $44,000 out of its stated goal of $2 million.

""That is another violation of religious freedom. It's very discriminatory,"" she continued. ""So, when we are denied the opportunity and the right to proclaim the Gospel freely in this nation that was founded upon ... that right, it's a terrible injustice. My uncle did say injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I know we can all agree. It's wrong to take the life of a baby in the womb. It's wrong to silence those voices of people who want to proclaim our faith and all of those aren't just civil rights injustices, but they are an injustice against God's will.""

According to an update on the crowdfunding page, ""Facebook has banned us from inviting friends to 'Like' our page and from 'Sharing' our PAID ads.""

The Christian Post has reached out to Facebook for comment on the situation. A response is pending.

""It is outrageous that Facebook purports to be apolitical when there have been trends of blocking pages of conservative causes, such as our 'Roe v. Wade' movie page,"" fellow executive producer Jalesia McQueen told Breitbart in a statement.

The news comes as Facebook is frequently criticized for having bias against and censoring conservative Christians.

Earlier this month, Facebook unpublished the popular Facebook page of Warriors for Christ ministry, which had over 225,000 followers and spoke critically of things like homosexuality, transgenderism and abortion. Facebook told The Christian Post that the page was removed because it violated its policies on hate speech and bullying.

Additionally, Facebook refused to take action this week after popular Christian mommy blogger Elizabeth Johnston, best known as ""The Activist Mommy,"" voiced concern with a Facebook group that was titled ""I will find Activist Mommy and burn whoever runs it alive.""

Officials of the social media giant ruled that the group did not violate Facebook community standards because it was determined that the group was ""satirical.""

""With 2 billion users, it can be argued that Facebook has become a public utility and thus cannot discriminate against users based upon their political or religious views,"" Johnston told CP on Tuesday. ""Conservative users who don't tow the liberal line on issues like Islam, abortion, and homosexuality are repeatedly banned and silenced in an Orwellian manner for expressing their valid concerns, thus causing conservatives to cry out for an alternative platform that welcomes the free exchange of ideas.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Facebook Lifts Ban on Paid Ads for Pro-Life Film Produced by MLK's Niece After Appeal,,,[''],"Facebook said Thursday that it has lifted its ban on paid ads for a fundraising effort connected to Alveda King's upcoming documentary that highlights the ""real untold story"" of abortion in the United States and the history of eugenics associated with Planned Parenthood.",,,
86,105,christianpost.com,reliable,https://www.christianpost.com/news/iranian-christian-convert-leads-1500-muslims-christ-sweden-214267/,"(Screencap: YouTube/Tidningen Dagen) Annahita Parsan (L), minister in the Church of Sweden, in a video posted on April 28, 2017.

An Iranian convert to Christianity who is now an ordained minister in the Church of Sweden says she has helped bring nearly 1,500 Muslims to Christ over the past five years.

Annahita Parsan told Fox News in a report on Wednesday that her life, which has undergone huge tribulations, is ""completely different since coming to Jesus.""

The minister said she was raised in a Muslim home in Iran and married at 16, though a couple of years later her husband was killed in a car accident.

She had to fight for custody for her son, which she successfully won, and two years later was re-married to a man whose wife had died.

Her second husband started beating her son, and although she wanted a divorce it was impossible for her to do because she was pregnant with a second child.

Parsan, her daughter, and the rest of the family fled as refugees in 1984 in the wake of the Iran-Iraq conflict, but met great hardships, including spending a month in prison in Turkey because they did not have identification papers or passports.

Eventually they made it to Denmark, which is where Parsan started learning more about Jesus Christ.

""In about the first or second month there, a woman came to the door to speak about God. But it was not in my interest,"" Parsan said. ""I was so angry, I was so unhappy. But she came back the next day with a small Bible, so this time I asked Jesus to help me.""

She started reading the Bible, which she had to keep secret from her husband, and grew in the faith. But her family life only got worse and she attempted to take her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills after her husband physically attacked her.

She survived the assault and that was when she woke up in a hospital and realized she was being called for greater things.

""I was too scared to go home and the police came to the hospital to talk to me. Many people were helping me find a safe place to live, and I knew it was Jesus,"" Parsan recalled.

""And soon, the police called to tell me that they had uncovered a plot in which my abusive husband had planned to kidnap the children back to Iran. After that, we moved to Sweden, and the policeman told me that I have an angel on my shoulder.""

Two years after moving to Sweden she was baptized in the Christian faith. In 2006, she survived a car accident, which is when she said she realized God spared her life so that she could help Muslims come to Christ.

In 2012, Parson became a minister in the Church of Sweden, focusing much of her work on reaching out to the Muslim community and inviting them to explore the faith.

She has helped as many as 1,500 come to Christ in the past five years, she estimates, despite risks to her life.

""I have serious threats at least a couple of times per year, a threat of a knife attack or a bomb attack. I have a police officer attached to my case I can always call, and we have security during our services. I have other threats from my own distant family members,"" she revealed. ""But for me, what I do is worth it.""

Christians back in Iran meanwhile continue suffering intense persecution for their faith, believers have said, despite the claims of a prominent bishop who attempted to argue that they ""enjoy complete freedom.""

Bishop Sibo Sarkisian, the Armenian-Orthodox Bishop of Tehran, said last month that Iran grants Christian citizens ""every right to practice their faith, including observing their feasts such as Christmas,"" and said that the only thing they are prohibited from doing is sharing their faith publicly.

Mohabat News, which says it is the news agency of Iranian Christians, pointed out, however, that for millions of believers, including the growing numbers in Iran, evangelism is a biblical mandate, and is an essential part of the faith.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Iranian Christian Convert Leads 1,500 Muslims to Christ in Sweden",,,[''],"An Iranian convert to Christianity, now an ordained minister in the Church of Sweden, has said that she has helped bring close to 1,500 Muslims to Christ over the past five years, overcoming severe family abuse and death threats.",,,

Sarbanes Transit Center in Silver Spring, Maryland in a video posted to YouTube on Apr 10, 2016.

The United States Justice Department said that the Washington, D.C. public transit system violated the free speech rights of the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington by refusing to place it's Christmas advertisement on the side of Metro buses.

The Department of Justice filed a 14-page amicus brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Tuesday in defense of the archdiocese, which is suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority after its bus advertisement for the ""Find the Perfect Gift"" Christmas campaign was rejected.

The advertisement showed a silhouette of three shepherds and their sheep under a starry night. The advertisement also promoted the website, ""FindthePerfectGift.org."" Upon clicking the link, the page reads ""Jesus is the perfect gift.""

WMATA maintained that the ad was rejected because it violated guidelines that state that advertisements may not promote or oppose and religion or belief.

The archdiocese filed a lawsuit against the agency in November. However, a federal judge in December sided with WMATA, saying that the agency has the right to ban posters that have religious content. Although the Christmas season has ended, the archdiocese is continuing its legal battle because it intends to place similar ads in the future and wants WMATA's policy struck down.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department is now asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the federal judge's ruling.

""WMATA's rejection of the Archdiocese's proposed Christmas advertisement in this case falls squarely within the class of viewpoint discrimination ....,"" the Justice Department brief reads. ""In the context of Christmas advertising, WMATA's guidelines permit messages which generally express commercial or charitable viewpoints, but exclude messages that express religious viewpoints.""

""Had Macy's, for example, sought to run a Christmas-themed ad stating, 'Find the Perfect Gift,' and displaying an image of its jewelry, nothing in the guidelines would prohibit the company from doing so. But because the Archdiocese's proposal arguably conveyed the implicit message that 'JESUS is the perfect gift,' WMATA rejected it,"" the brief continued. ""An ad proclaiming that the perfect Christmas gift is jewelry and another that the perfect Christmas gift is Jesus obviously offer competing perspectives on the meaning of the holiday, yet WMATA permits only the former.""

The Justice Department argues that the the application of WMATA's guidelines is ""precisely the type of viewpoint discrimination"" that the Supreme Court precluded in the 1995 case of Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, in which the court ruled that the public school may not withhold funding from a Christian student publication that is otherwise available to secular student publications.

""As the Supreme Court has made clear, the First Amendment prohibits the government from discriminating against religious viewpoints,"" Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand said in a statement. ""By rejecting the Archdiocese's advertisement while allowing other Christmas advertisements, WMATA engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.""

According to the Washingtonian magazine, Metro's policy was revised after Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative attempted to place ads featuring cartoon depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

Since taking office in 2017, Sessions and President Donald Trump have vowed to promote religious liberty. Last October, Sessions issued a sweeping order on religious freedom, calling on federal agencies to ensure that the religious freedom of people and organizations are protected to the ""greatest extent practicable and permitted by law.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Justice Dept.

It's a practice that has been in place since 1946.

A Chick-fil-A restaurant in Fargo, North Dakota, is asking for forgiveness following a controversial decision to kick out a mother for breast-feeding her child, with the owner being accused of telling the woman that men can see her ""indecency.""

Macy Hornung, the mother, wrote in a Facebook message on Sunday that she was told to leave the restaurant after staff saw her breast-feeding her baby.

""The owner came to our table where I was showing no more than the upper portion of my breast, barely more than what was visible in my shirt and asked me to cover. I tried to explain that I couldn't, because my baby refuses to be covered and she started harping about the children and men who can see my indecency and I need to cover,"" Hornung explained.

""I said they could practice the simple art of looking away and tried to cite North Dakota breast-feeding laws. She told me if I chose not to cover, then she would have to ask me to leave, so I told her my review would reflect my experience and I would be relaying the experience in every local mommy group,"" she added.

Later the same day Kimberly Flamm, the owner of the store in question, posted a Facebook message of her own where she apologized for the incident.

""I would like to publicly apologize to Macy Hornung for the way I handled the situation on Saturday,"" Flamm wrote.

""I ask for your forgiveness on this matter as I learn from it. My goal is to provide a warm and welcoming environment for all of my guests.""

The situation continues to spark debates online, with some stating that breast-feeding is not something to be done in a public restaurant.

""I personally do not want to see a mother breast-feed her child while I am trying to eat my lunch or dinner. I think she only did this to see how far she could push the envelope. I have nothing against breast-feeding but in a public restaurant is not one of them,"" one person wrote.

Others, such as Lindzey Dianna, pushed back.

""I'm shocked at some of the comments on here. Are people really that stupid they would get offended over a baby eating? You have 360 degrees to which you can direct your vision, if a mom feeding her child offends you so much, then avert to the remaining 359. If you're still overcome by the awful egregious site of a breast, then you can try eating in the bathroom or your car,"" she wrote.

Debate over breast-feeding was stirred in Christian circles last year as well, when a mother attending an Elevation Church campus in the Ballantyne neighborhood of Charlotte said that she was told to go feed her child in the ladies room, instead of the sanctuary during service.

""I just got kicked out of church for breast-feeding with a cover on and directed to the bathroom. Shame on you Elevation,"" mother Amanda Zilliken wrote on Facebook in August.

Elevation Church released a statement after a GoFundMe campaign began collecting money online to help Zilliken file a lawsuit.

""We do not have a policy that nursing mothers can't be in the sanctuary,"" the statement clarified.

""A volunteer had a conversation and felt both parties arrived at the same conclusion to exit mutually. We are sorry that this in any way offended anyone.

The highest court in the nation is scheduled to hear arguments in the case of National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra.

""The California law at issue compels pregnancy centers opposed to abortion—and only those opposed to abortion—to comply with burdensome requirements that force these centers to provide nonmedical information that contradicts their core message and moral beliefs,"" read the brief, filed Tuesday.

""... the FACT Act is a viewpoint-based regulation of speech. It is therefore unconstitutional unless it can surpass strict scrutiny. Tellingly, no government has ever succeeded in an attempt to justify a speech regulation that discriminates based on viewpoint.""

David French, a popular conservative columnist, filed a brief Monday on behalf of 41 conservative groups, arguing that the California law violated the moral conscience of pro-life activists.

""The State of California directly interferes with their work by forcing them to post messages actively opposed to their lifesaving efforts,"" argued French.

""It is hard to imagine a greater imposition on individual conscience. It is hard to imagine a more repugnant form of forced speech.""

A brief filed by groups including the National Association of Evangelicals, Concerned Women for America, the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, and Samaritan's Purse called the law ""viewpoint discriminatory"" and that ""forcing private parties to communicate the State's message is unjustified and unjustifiable.""

In 2015, the California passed Assembly Bill 775 of Reproductive FACT Act. The law mandated that all licensed pregnancy health centers, among other things, include a sign that refers patients to abortion clinics.

""The notice shall state: 'California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services (including all FDA-approved methods of contraception), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women,'"" read AB 775.

Failure to comply with AB 775 could result in a $500 fine on the first offense and then a $1,000 fine for each offense after that.

In October 2016, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law, agreeing with a lower court decision that the FACT Act ""survives any level of scrutiny"" and ""does not discriminate based on viewpoint.""

""Instead, the Act applies to all licensed and unlicensed facilities, regardless of what, if any, objections they may have to certain family planning services,"" read the opinion.

""The Licensed Notice and the Unlicensed Notice do not imply or suggest any preference regarding family-planning services.""

Last November, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal, limiting their hearing to the question of if ""the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Forcing Pro-Life Groups to Promote Abortion 'Discriminatory,' 'Unconstitutional,' 'Repugnant': Conservatives to SCOTUS",,,[''],Numerous conservative groups and more than a hundred members of Congress have filed amicus briefs urging the United States Supreme Court to strike down a California law that compels pro-life centers to promote abortion.,,,

Far be it from us to explain to the pope how the devil actually works, but . . .

Pope: Gosh, this fake news is the work of the devil



The pope who buys the media’s “climate change” nonsense hook, line and sinker has now decided “fake news” is the work of the devil. Well. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a first step. But as he so often does when he’s dealing with matters in the civic and political realm, the pope seems a bit too deferential to established institutions on the matter of truth, objectivity and fairness. He also doesn’t seem to really understand all that well how the digital world works.

According to the pope, the devil wants to trick you, but all you have to do is follow the guidance of the media, education and technology establishment and you’ll be fine: “The tragedy of disinformation is that it discredits others, presenting them as enemies, to the point of demonizing them and fomenting conflict,” the pope wrote, whereas true statements tend to “promote informed and mature reflection leading to constructive dialogue.” The pope portrayed latter-day makers of fake news as followers of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, the devil, who persuaded Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thus ushered in the “tragic history of human sin.” Pope Francis praised education and regulation to combat fake news, and encouraged tech and media companies in efforts to verify the “personal identities concealed behind millions of digital profiles.” But the pope laid the greatest responsibility with journalists, whom he called on to reject “falsehoods, rhetorical slogans and sensational headlines” in favor of a “journalism of peace.”

There’s so much wrong here, it’s hard to know where to start. Clearly, the pope is buying the mainstream media’s default definition of “fake news,” which is the nonsense headlines coming from schlock web sites dressed up to look like mainstream media. There’s one called ABCNews.com.co, for example, that is designed to make people think they’re looking at the ABC News site. Fake! Not really ABC News. That’s easy. But if the pope thinks that’s as fake as fake gets, he’s overlooking the matter of lies told by the real ABC News. Real media! Fake information. See? The news can be just as fake when it’s coming from “real” journalists. And it’s more damaging when that happens because the credibility ascribed to these people - by the likes of the pope, among others - makes ordinary people assume they can believe what they’re being told. Maybe someone needs to sit the pope down and remind him of how Satan really operates. If Satan showed up at your door and handed you a pamphlet that said, “Jesus secretly colluded with Russians to import sex slaves to Miami,” or claimed your heretofore unknown Nigerian uncle had a multimillion-dollar fortune for you, not many people would believe him. Nonsense that ham-handed is easily sniffed out, and only the most extremely gullible in our midst are influenced by it. But what the Bible tells us about Satan is that he’s crafty. He doesn’t show up with a pitchfork, devil horns and a tail (even if the Jon Lovitz caricature is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen). Satan presents himself as having credibility, knowledge, insight and wisdom. He comes off as someone who’s got it together, can earn your trust and has a legitimate claim as an influencer. He seems like someone you should listen to. He seems like someone who will steer you right.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Pope: Gosh, this fake news is the work of the devil","Dan Calabrese, Because Without America, There Is No Free World.",,"['Conservative News', 'Conservative Newspaper']","News, Politics, Editorials, commentary, Canada Free Press, Because without America, there is no Free World",,,

However, when details drop, we can’t help ourselves. You know you don’t want to hear it, you know you shouldn’t want to hear it, but you have to hear it anyways especially if you know it’s going to make the orange buffoon look ridiculous.

With the recent revelations that Trump’s lawyer paid off porn star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, for her silence on an extramarital affair with Trump, we’re now getting drips of information on what Trump liked and asked her to do, and we’re an equal mixture of grossed out and entertained.

Mother Jones reported Thursday that emails between “Daniels” and political advisers for a possibly political campaign in 2009 included details about their affair.

‘According to 2009 emails between political operatives who were at the time advising Daniels on a possible political campaign, the adult film actor and director claimed that her affair with Trump included an unusual act: spanking him with a copy of Forbes magazine.’

Trump likes to be spanked. Let that sink in. Now, one must ask: Does it have to be a Forbes magazine or will any old magazine do?

Apparently, Trump wanted to be spanked with a Forbes magazine that had his face on the cover. Yes, Mother Jones confirmed a cover of Forbes does exist with Trump on it. The cover also features son Don Jr. and daughter Ivanka, which is beyond creepy.

Trump also allegedly asked her to accompany him to his hotel room to have sex when they first met but beforehand, he showed her another magazine with him on the cover.

So apparently, that’s the kink. Magazines with Trump’s face on them get him off. No wonder he likes to lie about being on the cover of TIME.

According to a Quinnipiac Poll, 50 percent of voters want the House to be taken over by Democrats.

‘American voters say 50 – 39 percent they would like to see the Democratic Party take control of the U.S. House of Representatives this year. Independent voters back the Democrats 45-37 percent.’

Additionally, a majority of voters want to see Democrats take the majority in the Senate.

‘By a similar 52 – 40 percent, voters want the Democrats to take control of the U.S. Senate this year. Independent voters want Democrats in control 47 – 37 percent.’

What in the world has happened? In just a year, people are wanting Republicans out of Congress. Quinnipiac found that 78 percent of those polled disapprove of the job Congress is doing. Of that 78 percent, 88 percent were Democrats and 66 percent were Republicans.

Republicans can thank their own failures on delivering the promises they made to their voters. One of the first orders of business was to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they failed miserably. Worse yet, they failed multiple times.

Furthermore, Republicans failed to deliver a decent candidate in the Alabama Senate race. They gave the people of Alabama such a bad candidate that Alabama actually put a Democrat in the Senate.

The only major success Republicans have pulled off is passing a tax reform bill and looking at poll results, it may be too late regardless.

With the possibility of a government shutdown, Republicans are losing ground and Democrats could actually reap the benefits in the 2018 mid-term elections.

Additionally only 40 percent of voters felt good about the direction America was headed.

‘A total of 40 percent of American voters are “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the way things are going in the nation today, as 59 percent are “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied.”‘

They noted this is actually considered to be the “highest level of satisfaction” since a 2005 poll. However, Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll noted:

‘It has been 13 years since Americans have felt this good about life in the U.S., but the numbers suggest there is a long way to go.’

Now, when asked who they would blame for a government shutdown, it was fairly split between Republicans and Democrats. Thirty-two percent would blame Republicans, 34 percent would blame Democrats, and 21 percent would blame Trump himself.

On the issues, Quinnipiac found 73 percent would support a DACA bill to address the issue of the Dreamers. Out of that 73 percent, Republicans were split with 49 percent supporting one and 40 percent opposing.

On the issue of the ongoing investigation into Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign, 52 percent felt it was a legitimate investigation compared to 43 percent who felt it was a “witch hunt.”

If Democrats can maintain this momentum, there stands a very good chance that control of the House and Senate will shift from red to blue. However, it’s far from guaranteed and there are still many months before election day.

While clearing off your car may seem like a certain amount of vanity, it is really a functional issue. It helps you see better as you navigate the road. But that is not the only benefit you get from clearing your car of ice and snow. It also helps protect and lives of the other drivers on the road.

In the viral video we have for you below, you will see the shocking moment a block of ice lifts off a speeding SUV and smashes into the windshield of a car driving behind it.

Fortunately, the car that got hit has a dashboard camera running to help protect themselves from accidents like this. Because they have proof that it is the other car’s fault, it will be easier for them to get the insurance company to pay them for the damage.

Although the ice block accident happened about two years ago, it is still circulating through the internet. Because climate change is causing such cold, wintry weather this year, people are eager to remember how to stay safe on the road. And the reminder that ice can fly off a person’s car is a good way to recall the facts.

Since it was uploaded, the footage has been viewed more than three million times. And when you press play below you’ll understand why its influence is so far-reaching.

The victim of the ice attack was Jeffrey Cote. He shared the video and uploaded the following description:

“An ice sheet flew off the top of an SUV and destroyed my windshield, bent my wiper arm, and damaged my side mirror. Occurred at 8:45 am 12/30/15 on I-495S at Mile 112.8 Car: 2003 Saab 9-5 Aero Wagon,” Cote wrote with complete accuracy. He wanted the situation to be documented correctly. “If I had braked harder, I could have avoided impact, but it initially appeared the piece was going to fall in front of me.”

When it was all said and done, the ice caused a lot of damage to his vehicle, damage that would require the car to be out of commission while it got fixed. And it happened because the SUV driver was too lazy to clean their vehicle correctly.

Because Cote saw it coming, he wishes that he had avoided it better. But hindsight is always 20-20, as the saying goes.

“This dashcam video shows what can go wrong if you’re lazy and you don’t clear that huge block of snow and ice off of the roof of your car – it can fly off and crush the car behind you.”

Now that you have seen the damage that flying ice can cause make sure you go out and clean your car of ice and snow next time you’re hit with a storm this winter. Think of the other drivers, and you’ll help make the roads safer for all of us.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Driver Films The Moment Flying Object Nearly Takes Her Life.

97,116,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/model-who-boasts-she-transformed-into-an-african-american-via-chemicals-makes-odd-new-claim/,"Martina Big, a 28-year-old white German model, has turned herself black through a series of chemical injections and a mega-watt tanning bed. The model, who boasts her giant breast size via implants of size 32S, has spent more than $50,000 to become “exotic Barbie,” with skin that she describes as “dark, crispy brown.”

Chemical injections of Melanotan into her skin help her get that dramatic dark color. She started this transformation in 2012, opting for implants because she didn’t think she was “curvy enough” and hoping to darken her skin, as she explained the goal: “darker and darker and see what the limits are.”

Martina is a fan of her skin color, saying, “I love the contrast of my bright blonde hair and my dark, crispy brown skin. I love seeing the reactions of people. I can see their big eyes when I walk past and their shocked faces, thinking ‘how is this possible?'”

She further explained, “Yes, I have the skin of an African girl, but I am not pretending to be a black girl. I’m going to create a unique and exotic Barbie with dark tan, bright blonde hair and exaggerated curves. I like this look.”

Of the reaction she gets, she says that people don’t understand “because they have never seen a white girl change her skin to African dark before.” Once they get a better understanding, she says they tell her to “go darker” with the tone.

And her boyfriend, Michael, fully supports her, as he added: “I hope for the future that Martina will continue inflating her breasts, inflating her lips, getting more tanned and getting big butt implants.” Those are definitely some goals.

Michael has gotten the tanning injections as well, taking a page from his girlfriend, as he explained: “I didn’t want to go quite as dark as Martina but I support her and like her new look very much. I am the boyfriend of the woman with the largest breasts in Europe.”

While Melanotan is not approved by the FDA, it is available from online retailers. With the tanning bed exposure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain that “indoor tanning can cause skin cancers including melanoma (the deadliest type of skin cancer), basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma” as well as “cataracts and cancers of the eye (ocular melanoma).”

Those who commented on The Maury Show video about Martina had plenty to say, including one person who noted: “I’m a black female and I think its cool that she appreciates dark skin. She expressed wanting to learn more about the culture. She didnt come out acting ghetto or talking in an offensive way.”

However, another person responded: “It’s not cool. It’s apparent to just about most people, that this woman has mental health issues. She went from trying to look like Pamela Anderson to trying to look like a black woman. Her breast size is absurd and the doctor who did that should be disciplined. What she is doing to her body is damaging and she is going to wind up as much a physical mess and she is a mental mess.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Model Who Boasts She Transformed Into An African American Via Chemicals, Makes Odd New Claim",Wendy Michaels,,[''],,,,
98,117,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/after-eating-sushi-man-finds-a-five-foot-creature-wiggling-its-way-out-of-him/,"Sushi is a trendy dish. It comes from Japan, and its two main ingredients are raw fish and rice. But if you eat too much sushi, you could end up like this poor California man. Because he enjoyed the Japanese delicacy every day, he had a five-foot-long tapeworm come wriggling out of his body. And it left him rethinking his urge to eat so much sushi.

The man, who lives in Fresno, California, rushed to the emergency room because he was suffering from horrible diarrhea. And when he saw Dr. Kenny Bahn at the emergency room, the doctor took notes, because he was planning on telling the patient’s story on his podcast called “This Won’t Hurt A Bit.”

When the California man came into the Fresno Community Regional Medical Center, he told the doctors, “I really want to be treated for worms.”

Dr. Bahn thought the man was crazy. But when he took a closer look, he saw that the sushi eater was horribly infected. The disgusting proof could not be denied when Dr. Bahn helped pull the five-foot worm out of the man’s body.

“I take out a toilet paper roll, and wrapped around it, of course, is what looks like this giant, long tapeworm,” Bahn said on his tell-all podcast.

When the doctor unraveled the tapeworm, it was 5-and-a-half-feet long. That’s taller than most women in the United States. That’s a huge thing having suck the life out of you from the inside.

The patient told Bahn that the worm felt like it was “wriggling out” of him. And it hurt so badly that it felt like “his guts were coming out.” Dr. Bahn decided to take the man’s story of suffering and share it on his audio podcast to impress his listeners.

When the man sat on the toilet to push the worm out of him, it did not work. He then reached behind and started to pull on it. And when he did, the tapeworm began to resist. It did not want to leave the warm habitat of the man’s bowels. It wanted to remain in there, steal his life away from him, and reproduce.

When the man learned that it was “only a tapeworm,” he was flooded with relief. Because those are treatable, he did not have to worry about some other kind of lasting health problem. And if there were any more worms in his body, he was given medication that should help remove them in due time.

According to a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year, wild-caught salmon caught in the waters off Alaska could contain worms. And because this man was eating raw salmon in his sushi, he was unknowingly putting his body at risk. If he had known, he would have changed his eating habits.

The patient confirmed that he will stay away from sushi for some time yet.

Will you think twice about indulging in this Japanese delicacy after hearing about this worm problem?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"After Eating Sushi, Man Finds A Five Foot Creature Wiggling It’s Way Out Of Him",Alexander Smith,,[''],,,,

She uses her face to gain followers and helps other places sell their products by sharing them with her countless fans.

So when this vlogger, Elle Darby, approached the owner of Charleville Lodge Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, she asked the hotel owner to allow her to stay at the hotel for FREE. And she said that if she got a free room, she’d promote the Dublin hotel on her social media page and help get it even more business.

But the owner laughed at her request. The owner, Paul Stenson, hit the social media star with scorn and shared the email he wrote back to her online, so everyone could see what he actually said.

In response, the YouTube star posted a video claiming that the hotel bullied her.

Because she wanted to establish a “possible collaboration” with the hotel and get to stay there for free for herself and her partner, the hotel denied her entitled request.

“I would love to feature you in my Youtube videos/dedicated Instagram stories/posts to bring traffic to your hotel and recommend others to book up in return for free accommodation,” she wrote.

But the hotel owner thought her request was ludicrous. Stenson poured scorn back into the online exchange and has since banned the bloggers from his hotel.

Darby, who is based in Bath, Somerset, told the hotel owner that she had 87,000 YouTube subscribers and 76,000 Instagram followers. And she does “work as a social media influencer, mainly lifestyle, beauty & travel based.”

Stenson thought her request was insane and her line of work lacked “self-respect and dignity.”

He wrote:

“Thank you for your email looking for free accommodation in return for exposure. It takes a lot of balls to send an email like that if not much self-respect and dignity. If I let you stay here in return for a feature in your video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you? Who is going to pay the housekeepers who clean your room?”

He then wrote:

“The waiters who serve you breakfast? The receptionist who checks you in? Who is going to pay for the light and heat you use during your stay? The laundering of your bed sheets? The water rates? Maybe I should tell my staff they will be featured in your video in lieu of receiving payment for work carried out while you’re in residence?”

Because the YouTube star hit back with a complaint on video, her fans also joined the fray. Some accused Stenson of bullying, while other said Darby was a “spoiled brat.”

In her video, she said:

“I feel disgusting having to say this. As a 22-year-old girl, who’s running her own business from her home, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. These were all 30 years plus people internet bullying a 22-year-old girl who is just trying to run her own business and raise awareness of what appeared to be a stunning Dublin hotel.”

100,120,christianpost.com,reliable,https://www.christianpost.com/news/school-district-appeals-texas-cheerleaders-bible-verse-case-to-state-supreme-court-214263/,"(Facebook/Support Kountze Kids Faith)

A Texas public school district is hoping the state Supreme Court will rule that high school cheerleaders don't have the constitutional right to include Bible verses on banners displayed at football games.

Kountze Independent School District filed a petition with the Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday after the Texas Court of Appeals in Beaumont ruled last year that the school district does not reserve the right to ban cheerleaders from including Christian messages on large colorful banners that the school football team runs through before the start of games.

The lower court ruled in September that the cheerleaders' signs constituted private speech, not government speech. The school district's appeal for rehearing was subsequently denied by the Beaumont court.

Attorneys for the school district have argued that the lower court's ruling goes against previous federal court precedents, such as the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court's ruling in 2011 in the case of a cheerleader at Silsbee High School who refused to cheer for an athlete who she accused of sexually assaulting her.

The court reasoned in that case that cheerleaders acted as a ""mouthpiece through which [the school district] could disseminate speech — namely, support for its athletic teams.""

""In federal court, a cheerleader who cheers at a game engages in government speech, but in state court, she engages in private speech,"" lawyer Thomas Brandt wrote in the appeal, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.

""This creates confusion for all Texas school districts,"" he said, adding that the banners ""were held by public school cheerleaders while they were cheering for the school's football team, while they were in uniform at a school-sponsored event, and while they were on the school's football field to which access was limited by the school.""

The First Liberty Institute, a religious freedom law group that is defending the cheerleaders, decried the school district's appeal.

""The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the Kountze cheerleaders have a right to have religious speech on their run-through banners — banners on which the cheerleaders painted messages they chose, with paint they paid for, on paper they purchased. Why is the school district continuing to fight against this decision and the cheerleaders?"" First Liberty Institute lawyer Hiram Sasser said in a statement shared with The Christian Post.

""When will the school district stop filing appeal after appeal and finally accept that the cheerleaders are free to have religious speech on their run through banners?"" he questioned. ""Hopefully the Texas Supreme Court will not even require the cheerleaders to respond and thus bring an end to the school district's scorched earth litigation tactics against the Kountze cheerleaders. Enough is enough.""

The case dates back to 2012 when the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national organization that advocates for strict adherence to separation of church and state, complained that religious messages on the run-through banners constituted a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

According to the Beaumont Enterprise, the school district's attorneys also argue that the case is now moot because all of the original cheerleaders involved in the case have since graduated or are no longer a part of the team.

However, David Starnes, a lawyer who also represented the girls in the case, argues that the case is not moot because the mother of one of the students who didn't make the team in 2017 filed a grievance after her daughter didn't make the team. The mother claimed that her daughter didn't make the team in retaliation for suing the school district, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.

""It is remarkable that the lawyers for the Kountze School District are making the same, worn-out, rejected arguments, yet again,"" Starnes said in a statement to KFDM/Fox 4. ""Enough is enough. They are fully aware that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'""

""Of course the Ninth Court of appeals simply followed the law and ruled in their favor,"" Starnes continued. ""It is inexplicable that the District's lawyers continue trying to suppress the cheerleaders' constitutionally-protected religious speech, when the well-reasoned opinion of the Ninth Court of Appeals simply follows the U.S. Supreme Court law written in 1969. To do otherwise, would lead to an absurd result.

Refugees do not show up in the Mediterranean Sea as if from nowhere. By the time they get into their flimsy boats on the Libyan coastline, they have lived many, many dangerous lives. They would have left their increasingly unproductive fields in western and eastern Africa, fled wars in the Horn of Africa, in Sudan and in places as far as Afghanistan, and traveled great distances to get to what they see as the final leg of their journey.

What they want is to make it to Europe, which since the early days of colonialism has broadcast itself as the land of milk and honey. Old colonial ideas and the wealth of Europe built from colonial labor beckons. It is a siren for the wretched of the earth. It has ended for many Africans in virtual concentration camps in Libya, where refugees that Europe does not want now linger — some sold into slavery.

To get to Libya, the migrants and refugees have to cross the Sahara Desert, which in Arabic is known, rightly, as the Greatest Desert (al-Sahara al-Kubra). It is vast, hot and dangerous. Old salt caravans — the Azalai — mostly managed by the Tuareg peoples, would run between Mali as well as Niger and Libya. They would carry gold, salt, weapons and captured human beings as objects of trade.

Those old caravans still make their journey, moving from one water source to the next, the camels as exhausted as the Tuareg. Newer caravans have supplanted these older ones. Camels are not their mode of transport. They prefer buses, pickup trucks and jeeps to ferry humans and cocaine towards Europe, while guns and money comes southwards. These newer caravans drive along unmarked paths, heading between sand dunes, searching for old tire tracks that have been buried in disorienting sandstorms.

Surviving the Sand

The Sahara is dangerous. The journey in a pickup truck could take three days, at best, or the refugees and cocaine mules could find themselves dying from dehydration, extremists, smugglers or the security forces in the region.

There are many people ready to prey on the travellers and on the smugglers, whose cars are routinely stolen. No proper account exists of dead refugees. This past June, the UN Refugees Agency reported the death of 44 migrants who died of dehydration and heat stroke when their truck broke down between the Nigerien cities of Agadez and Dirkou.

The UN had saved at least 600 migrants between April and June. “Saving lives in the desert is becoming more urgent than ever,” said Giuseppe Loprete, the Niger Chief of Mission for the International Organisation for Migration.

To prevent migrants from reaching the Mediterranean, France has asked five African countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) to join its G5 Sahel Initiative. The Sahel is the belt that runs across Africa below the Sahara Desert.

The European Union has also contributed to this project. The Europeans want to move their southern border from the northern edge of the Mediterranean Sea to the southern rim of the Sahara Desert. French military bases run across the Sahel, as the United States builds an enormous base in Agadez (Niger) from where it will fly drones to provide aerial support. The military has arrived in the Sahel to stop the flow of migrants.

Cocaine Trail

Agadez, where the United States military is spending $100 million to build its drone base, sits at the crossroads of our contemporary crises. Refugees come to it in desperation, their land made miserable by trade policies that discriminate against small farmers and by desertification caused by carbon capitalism. As the United States government has made it difficult for cocaine to enter the U.S. from Central America, the cocaine mafia have moved its operations to this central belt of Africa.

A leading politician in Niger, Cherif Ould Abidine, who died in 2016, was known as Mr. Cocaine. Billions of dollars of cocaine now moves through the Sahel into the Sahara and upwards to Europe. The pickup trucks that carry refugees and cocaine go past the town of Arlit, where French multinational corporations are harvesting uranium (Oxfam noted in 2013, “One of every three light bulbs in France is lit, thanks to Nigerien uranium”). So here we have it: refugees, cocaine, uranium and a massive military enterprise.

Men from Gambia and from Mali wait outside a smugglers’ compound. His Toyota Hilux, the camel of this new trade, sits near the gate. The men are wearing sunglasses. This is their defense once they enter the desert. They are apprehensive. Their future, however grim, must be better than their present. These are gamblers. They are willing to take the chance. The engine fires up. They throw their modest belonging onto the truck. It is time for their azalai.

102,122,blackagendareport.com,unreliable,https://blackagendareport.com/puerto-rico-homeowners-brace-another-disaster-foreclosures,"Puerto Rico Homeowners Brace for Another Disaster: Foreclosures

“Maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes.”

Lenders to Puerto Rican homeowners have kicked foreclosures into high gear in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, skirting local and federal borrower protections. According to attorneys and experts, lenders have ignored federal moratoria on foreclosures; placed notices of default in newspapers where they’re unlikely to be seen; sent files to homeowners in English rather than Spanish; and required residents to complete tasks that are borderline impossible without electrical power yet fully restored, among other abuses.

The foreclosure horrors add to Puerto Rico’s Dickensian experience of late. Close to 35 percent of the island remains without power after Hurricane Maria, with full restoration not expected until May. At least 100,000 people have left the island. Abandoned pets are everywhere. Government services have been slashed or hobbled. Even one major proposed solution, wiping out Puerto Rico’s debt, will take a personal cost: The bonds represent the life savings of many residents to whom the financial products were aggressively marketed without explanation of the downsides.

“The economy of the island could collapse, as the Republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports.”

Ultimately, the expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard-hit areas in the U.S. mainland during the Great Recession. According to the New York Times, roughly one-third of 425,000 Puerto Rican homeowners have fallen behind on mortgage payments, and with jobs scarce after the hurricane, that number will likely grow. In fact, the economy of the island could collapse, as the Republican tax bill imposes a 20 percent tax on offshore exports — a category that includes Puerto Rican manufacturing.

But if you think America learned lessons from the orgy of illegality that accompanied foreclosures in the United States after 2008, just look to Puerto Rico. Despite new rules to prevent foreclosure fraud, Puerto Rico appears to be Exhibit A in its continuation — and it’s only just beginning.

Foreclosures ravaged Puerto Rico even before Maria, up 130 percent in 2016 relative to a decade before. Adding two hurricanes to the equation makes the island’s residents ripe for a gargantuan ripoff.

The foreclosure process in Puerto Rico resembles the judicial foreclosure process on the mainland. Lenders must follow federal guidelines on notifying borrowers of default and giving them an opportunity to cure debt. Then lenders can file a lawsuit for foreclosure. Judges are obligated to impose mandatory mediation, bringing borrowers and lenders to the table to work out a resolution. Only if that doesn’t work can lenders obtain a judgment and evict the homeowner.

“The expected wave of foreclosures could prove worse than what happened in the most hard-hit areas in the U.S. mainland during the Great Recession.”

However, what sound like substantive protections for the borrower often don’t play out that way. “Many times they don’t know about their rights,” said Veronica Rivera, a coordinator for Derecho a tu Casa or Right to Your House — a coalition of legal aid groups providing information and assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. “They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs. It surprises me sometimes how much trust people have in the banks.”

For example, after Hurricane Maria, the federal government imposed a foreclosure moratorium on homes either backed by government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or those with Federal Housing Administration insurance. The FHA moratorium was recently extended to March 19, 2018, but it only applies to a sliver of loans. The Fannie and Freddie moratoria were set to expire on December 31, but the lenders made an extension until March 31. Banks and mortgage investors voluntarily offered three months of relief from payments, but homeowners had to call their lender to trigger it. “The banks said you have to call,” said Rivera. “We didn’t have internet for more than a month, didn’t have electricity, no communication. Many didn’t know.”

Indeed, a report from the public interest firm Hedge Clippers shows that one company, Roosevelt Cayman Asset Co., has 289 active foreclosure cases in federal court and another 56 in local Puerto Rican courts. Federal courts, typically not a venue for foreclosure cases, are seen as faster than local courts, so offshore companies like Roosevelt lean heavily on them.

“They think that the bank would understand that they can’t pay because they lost their jobs.”

Even after the hurricane, Roosevelt has filed motions for default judgment or eviction in the cases. The Intercept has reviewed lists of dozens of these motions. For example, Roosevelt filed a motion for eviction of Ernesto Santiago-Guzman and his family on October 11, three weeks after Maria hit, and a motion for default judgment against Elias Rivera-Rivera on October 12. U.S. District Judge Gustavo Gelpí denied that request because the case was only initiated a month before the hurricanes, “which trashed the entire island of Puerto Rico.” The judge postponed the case until March.

Other judges have not been so kind. Docket entries show that Roosevelt secured a default judgment against Carlos Gonzalez-Luna’s property on October 23.

Many of the loans Roosevelt acted on were purchased in a fire sale from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the 2015 failure of Doral Bank, a lender with a large portfolio of Puerto Rican mortgages. These loans were severely delinquent, some over two years. Federally insured distressed mortgages in Puerto Rico have become an appetizing target for Wall Street land speculators seeking to make a quick buck and turn Puerto Rico into a playground for the rich.

An unidentified Puerto Rico homeowner submitted a comment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s consumer complaint database, claiming that Roosevelt is “not flexible and expressed that they just want to acquire the home to build their house portfolio.”

“Federally insured distressed mortgages in Puerto Rico have become an appetizing target for Wall Street land speculators.”

Critics allege Roosevelt uses sleazy tactics to get default judgments. “Since the hurricane, they’ve sought to use service by publication, publishing names in the newspaper to serve the lawsuits. Who’s reading the newspaper these days?” asked Jim Baker, founder of the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, who helped with the Hedge Clippers report. “Then they ask for default judgment because they served papers and the homeowners haven’t responded. In most cases, they’re getting [the judgment],” he added, referring to Roosevelt.

Roosevelt is an affiliate of Rushmore Loan Management Services, which in turn services loans owned by private equity giant TPG Capital, managers of $73 billion in assets. While TPG spokesperson Patrick Clifford claims only a client relationship between Rushmore and TPG, Rushmore’s principal owners are senior TPG executives. A June 2017 report lists Rushmore as the second-largest repossessor on the island, behind only Banco Popular, Puerto Rico’s main bank.

(A new TPG “impact investing” fund includes on its board Pierre Omidyar, founder of First Look Media, The Intercept’s parent company.)

Activist groups held protests outside TPG headquarters in Manhattan, calling for an end to foreclosures on the island. Related demonstrations were held in eight cities around the world. “This is the first of many companies hurting the people of Puerto Rico and it will be one of many we will be scrutinizing,” said Julio López Varona, a spokesperson for Hedge Clippers, in a statement. “We have asked TPG and Rushmore directly to stop their foreclosures and we will continue to target them until they stop harming Puerto Ricans.”

This appears to have made an impact. Rushmore claims to have “instituted an immediate suspension of foreclosure proceedings in Puerto Rico,” per spokesperson Steven Goldberg, including stopping notice by publication. The length of the freeze is indefinite.

“The foreclosure moratorium expires December 31 for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by March for FHA-insured loans.”

“Rushmore pursues loan modification or other alternatives to foreclosure first in all cases and remains fully committed to working to keep as many borrowers as possible in their homes,” Goldberg said, “especially in light of the extremely challenging circumstances caused by the hurricane.” He said the company has conducted “extensive outreach efforts” to contact borrowers, given communication problems on the island. Goldberg even provided the number to Rushmore’s Puerto Rico office, (877) 509-8389, and its Spanish and English websites, urging borrowers to contact them to seek a resolution to their situations.

TPG’s Clifford added, “We’ve been in constructive dialogue with various advocacy groups, and we plan to continue having those conversations because they are important.”

Even if homeowners were lucky or savvy enough to fall under the foreclosure moratorium, it expires December 31 for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and by March for FHA-insured loans. Many have called for those to be extended, but no decision has been made.

The voluntary payment moratoria also expire by January. In an opinion piece for Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Dia, Ricardo J. Ramos González, who runs the Legal Aid Clinic at the University of Puerto Rico’s School of Law, warned residents that the payment moratorium merely comprised forbearance, not a cancellation of payments. “Those who accepted the moratorium on payments, could very well face a process of collection and eventual foreclosure of their main home, if they are required to pay three months plus the current term,” González wrote. He endorsed a yearlong moratorium on foreclosures, similar to those instituted in some states during the Great Depression.

When foreclosure notices and letters from lenders come in the mail in Puerto Rico, they are typically in English. But many Puerto Ricans only speak Spanish. Unlike in local courts, federal court filings are similarly in English, putting homeowners at a disadvantage.

“Foreclosure notices and letters from lenders are typically in English, but many Puerto Ricans only speak Spanish.”

Rivera of Derecho a tu Casa claims that lenders have been negotiating loss mitigation with borrowers while also pursuing foreclosure, a scheme known as “dual tracking,” which is supposed to be illegal under federal mortgage servicing laws and local law in Puerto Rico. The mediation process has not assisted borrowers more generally. “Lawyers cannot participate in the process unless the client gives us special power,” said Rivera. Worse, lenders send representatives who are not empowered to make decisions, she explained. “It’s a pro forma process,” said Rivera. “The banks do not have to give a specific option.”

Foreclosure lawyers in Puerto Rico are also finding the same discrepancies in foreclosure processing that roiled the United States after the crisis. This is not surprising, since those errors never really stopped in the United States. Rivera alleges that investors who came in and scooped up distressed mortgages didn’t follow property records procedures. “There have been cases where there is no mortgage. They don’t have the note,” Rivera said.

The endgame of aggressively foreclosing on properties in Puerto Rico — where there is little hope of turning them around to make a profit — is unclear. Offshore lenders “made this investment a couple years ago,” said Baker of Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They’re churning through the portfolio. Maybe they believe the land is worth more than keeping people in the homes.” The insurance payouts also benefit offshore purchasers of distressed mortgages; that alone could turn a profit relative to the small price paid.

Derecho a tu Casa offers resources at its website to educate homeowners and also representation for those who qualify. “Many people get depressed and we want to give them hope,” Rivera said. “I can see the difference when I represent someone.”

“While the rest of the world celebrates their hopes for the New Year, the Congolese suffer repression and death.”

While the Black Agenda Report took a week off for the holidays, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni ordered his army to attack Béni Territory in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) two days before Christmas. Then, on New Year's Eve, Congolese President Joseph Kabila ordered his military police to attack Congolese peacefully protesting his refusal to relinquish power despite the expiration of his term in office at the end of December 2016. As of January 2, the death toll among the protesters had risen to 12, more had been wounded, and at least 120 had been arrested. I spoke to Boniface Musavuli, a native of Béni Territory, political exile in France, and author of Les Massacres de Béni and Genocide of the Congolese -- From Leopold II to Paul Kagame.

Ann Garrison: Boniface, the Congolese never seem to get a break, not even for the holidays, do they?

Boniface Musavuli: Yes, that's the case. While the rest of the world celebrates the holiday season and their hopes for the New Year, the Congolese suffer repression and death. The end of year period is not chosen at random. Most violent events in Congo occur between November and January.

AG: I’ve noted that too. Can you explain why?

BM: This period corresponds either to the great moment of international news dominated by the United States (presidential campaign and then transfer of power), or to the end-of-year celebrations. There is not a lot of media that can cover both the US presidential campaign, end-of-year celebrations, and events in an African country. In January 1961, Lumumba was assassinated during the transfer of power between Eisenhower and John Kennedy. In 1996-1997, the Congo was attacked by Rwanda and Uganda during the campaign for the re-election of Bill Clinton. In January 2001, President Laurent-Desire Kabila was assassinated during the passing of power between Bill Clinton and George Bush. At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, Rwanda and Uganda attacked Congo for the third time during the Obama campaign and transfer of power.

“Troops led by Rwandan officers are attacking the people of Béni to get them out of the way of their resource trafficking networks and territorial ambitions.”

AG: We spoke a week ago when the Uganda People's Defense Force (UPDF) announced that its attack aircraft had entered Congolese air space to bomb camps of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and that it was shelling the same camps with long range weapons from across the border. The UPDF then announced that they had killed 100 ADF fighters. Shouldn't that have been the end of the ADF, which the UN Group of Experts on DRC said had been reduced to 100 members by 2015?

Boniface Musavuli: The information published by the Ugandan army on the losses suffered by ""alleged ADF"" has not been confirmed from local sources. One must always doubt the information given by a force engaged in a conflict.

Ann Garrison: If the bombing and shelling is not hitting ADF militia members, who is it hitting? There have been a few reports of refugees crossing the Congolese border into Uganda, but no casualty reports that I can find.

BM: I think that the main objective of the Ugandan army is not to fight on Congolese soil, but rather to occupy. As I have previously explained, the ""ADF"" no longer exists as a military force and the ""alleged ADF"" are instead the excuse of some troops led by Rwandan officers who have infiltrated the Congolese army. They are attacking the people of Béni to get them out of the way of their resource trafficking networks and territorial ambitions.

Uganda can not fight against an enemy that no longer exists. On the other hand, Uganda has interests in eastern Congo and wants to protect them before the end of Joseph Kabila's reign.

“The main objective of the Ugandan army is not to fight on Congolese soil, but rather to occupy.”

AG: Uganda's New Vision seems to be the only Ugandan publication to have published a critical report—“UPDF on the spot over DR Congo mission”—and they quoted your remarks in our conversation extensively. An online publication called Actualité CD quoted Juma Balikwisha, Béni's Member of Congo’s Parliament, who, like you, accused the Ugandan army of coming to occupy, and said that Ugandan troops were on Congolese soil before the attack.

They also quoted Thomasa D'Awuin Muti, the President of North Kivu Province Civil Society, who said [translation from French]: ""Until today, we know that the neighbors destabilizing our country are Rwanda and Uganda. And so, using the destabilizers to stabilize is less thoughtful. When we went to the military authorities, they told us that they were not yet informed on a plan developed between the Congolese and Ugandan army and that they were surprised to learn that the Ugandan army is conducting bombing operations. You understand that there is not even planning between the FARDC [Congolese army] and the UPDF [Ugandan army].""

“We know that the neighbors destabilizing our country are Rwanda and Uganda.”

This is one of many contradictory reports as to whether or not the Congolese and Ugandan armies have been working together against the “alleged ADF” in Beni, but maybe we shouldn't expect consistency since they claim to be attacking a ghost militia in the first place. Can you help us make any sense of this?

BM: In reality, Uganda has always held the Congolese army in low regard. The Congo under Kabila could not create an army powerful enough to stop its aggressors from the east, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi since 1996. The armies of these three countries, and even of Angola on Congo’s southwest border, are accustomed to penetrating Congolese national territory and then leaving without being bothered by the Congolese government. However, my information is that the Ugandan army has not yet engaged troops on the ground, and that they continue instead to amass at the border.

AG: OK, let's turn to Kabila's New Year's Eve attacks on the peaceful marchers protesting his refusal to relinquish power on New Year’s Eve. On December 30, Reuters reported that Kabila had ordered telecommunications companies to cut internet and SMS text messaging services across the country ahead of planned anti-government demonstrations. How were you able to learn about what happened next in France?

BM: Communication services have indeed been cut. What is deplorable is that the minister who ordered the cuts, Mr. Emery Okundji, is a former active member of the opposition who joined Kabila. At the time he was in opposition, he was hostile to the practice of cutting off communications for political reasons. Kabila is discrediting the entire Congolese political class. We still managed to call our contacts on the ground.

“Kabila is discrediting the entire Congolese political class.”

AG: The Catholic Church, which called for the peaceful New Year's Eve protests, is the second most powerful institution in DRC, isn't it? Second only to the army?

BM: The Catholic Church is not a political or state institution. It can not be compared to the police or the army, which are state institutions. The Catholic Church is, however, the most respected and well-established civilian institution in the country. Catholicism is Congo's first religion with 50% of believers. During the New Year’s Eve March, many priests showed extraordinary courage by walking in the front line with the people.

AG: And what is the church calling on Kabila to do? Are they backing an interim president until elections can be organized?

BM: The Catholic Church had sponsored a political agreement in December 2016 between Kabila and the opposition to allow Kabila, whose constitutional mandate had expired, to be able to organize the elections in 2017. Kabila did not respect this agreement, and everything suggests that he will never hold elections. The Catholic Church is fighting for a transitional government without Kabila.

AG: And what would you like to see happen?

BM: The idea of a transition without Kabila is the most logical. Kabila did not organize elections because he has no intention of leaving power. However, for this idea to be implemented, Kabila must somehow be removed from power. Until then the nation is at a dead end.

AG: Will anything decisive happen without the agreement of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and/or the US?

BM: In fact, one of the keys to the crisis lies in the hands of the United Nations, and especially the United States. Kabila and his entourage must be subjected to international sanctions until they agree to withdraw from power.

AG: And where do the UNSC and the US seem to stand now?

BM: Americans, French and several African countries have not yet agreed on the need to get rid of Kabila quickly. The emissary of President Donald Trump, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, asked the Kabila regime to organize the elections that it failed to organize in 2017 in 2018. An electoral calendar was published providing for elections on December 23, 2018. But this date is likely to be ignored just as the December 2017 date was. And even if elections were held on that date, they would be so discredited by fraud that their results would give rise to massive challenges and a new crisis of legitimacy.

“Kabila must somehow be removed from power. Until then the nation is at a dead end.”

AG: Is there anything else you'd like to say?

BM: Congo is in a situation that requires a strong mobilization of the international community. Kabila and his followers are only concerned about one thing: to retain power. Meanwhile, social distress keeps worsening and the security situation keeps deteriorating. If nothing is done quickly, the crisis will only get further out of control.

Since President Donald Trump’s election, so-called Antifa activists have initiated violent clashes on college campuses and at right-wing gatherings throughout the nation. The group has been designated a terrorist group by the Dept of Homeland Security.

WND U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, the nation’s first Muslim congressman and a leading candidate for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is a Muslim Brotherhood operative and has been for years. He even went on a pilgrimage to Mecca paid for by subversive organization and used taxpayer money for a trip to Gaza where he met with terror operatives from Hamas.

As a mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood, which Congress is considering declaring a terrorist organization, Ellison should not even be member of congress.

Ellison also has close ties to Muslim American Society (MAS) one of more than a dozen groups spawned by the Muslim Brotherhood in documents filed by the FBI during the Holy Land Foundation trial in Dallas in 2007-08.

“The violent appropriation of Native land by white settlers was seen as an individual right in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, second only to freedom of speech.”

The Anglo-American settlers’ violent break from Britain in the late eighteenth century paralleled their search-and-destroy annihilation of Delaware, Cherokee, Muskogee, Seneca, Mohawk, Shawnee, and Miami, during which they slaughtered families without distinction of age or gender, and expanded the boundaries of the thirteen colonies into unceded Native territories.

The Declaration of Independence of 1776 symbolizes the beginning of the “Indian Wars” and “westward movement” that continued across the continent for another century of unrelenting U.S. wars of conquest. That was the goal of independence, with both the seasoned Indian killers of the Revolutionary Army and white settler-rangers/militias using extreme violence against Indigenous noncombatants with the goal of total domination. These forces were met with resistance movements and confederations identified with leaders such as Buckongeahelas of the Delaware; Alexander McGillivray of the Muskogee-Creek; Little Turtle and Blue Jacket of the Miami-Shawnee alliance; Joseph Brant of the Mohawk; and Cornplanter of the Seneca; as well as the great Tecumseh and the Shawnee-led confederation in the Ohio Valley. Without their sustained resistance, the intended genocide would have been complete; the eastern half of the continent was “ethnically cleansed” of Native nations by 1850, through forced relocation to “Indian Territory” west of the Mississippi.

“Without the indigenous people’s sustained resistance, the intended genocide would have been complete.”

The program of expansion and the wars against Native American civilization and the agricultural societies of the vast valley of the Ohio River and the Great Lakes region began before the Declaration with the French and Indian War of 1754–63, which was the North American extension of the Seven Years’ War between France and Britain in Europe. Britain’s victory over France in 1763 led to its domination of world trade, sea power, and colonial holdings for nearly two centuries. In the Treaty of Paris, France ceded Canada and all claims east of the Mississippi to Britain. In the course of that war, Anglo-American settlers intensified their use of counterinsurgent violence, which the Anglo settler elite dubbed “savage wars,” against Indigenous peoples’ resistance to their incursions into the territories of the Ottawa, Miami, Kickapoo, and the confederations identified with Pontiac’s leadership of the Great Lakes region, spreading to the Illinois and Ohio countries. By the end of the war, significant numbers of Anglo settlers had taken Indigenous lands beyond the colonies’ boundaries, and land speculation was a road to riches for a fortunate few.

To the settlers’ dismay, soon after the 1763 Treaty of Paris was signed, King George III issued a proclamation prohibiting British settlement west of the Allegheny-Appalachian mountain chain, ordering those who had settled there to relinquish their claims and return to the kingdom’s thirteen colonies. Soon it became clear that the British authorities needed far more soldiers to enforce the edict, as thousands of settlers ignored it and continued to pour over the mountains, squatting on Indigenous lands, forming armed militias, and provoking Indigenous resistance. In 1765, in order to enforce the Proclamation line, the British Parliament imposed the Stamp Act on the colonists, a tax on all printed materials that had to be paid in British pounds, not local paper money. The iconic colonial protest slogan “taxation without representation is tyranny” marked the surge of rebellion against British control, but it did not tell the whole story, considering what the tax was for: to pay the cost of housing, feeding, and transporting soldiers to contain and suppress the colonies from expanding further into Indian territory. The complaints iterated in the Declaration largely focus on the measures used by King George to prevent his rebellious subjects from grabbing more land: “[King George] has excited domestic Insurrections [slave revolts] amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages [Indigenous nations resisting genocidal wars], whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.”

“Thousands of settlers continued to pour over the mountains, squatting on Indigenous lands.”

By the early 1770s, terrorism waged by Anglo-American settlers against even Christianized Native communities within the colonies and violent encroachment on those outside the colonial boundaries raged, and illegal speculation in stolen Indian lands was rampant. In the southern colonies especially, farmers who had lost their land in competition with larger, more efficient, slave-worked plantations rushed for Native farmlands over the mountain range. These militant settlers—”rangers”—thus created the framework for the United States to appropriate Native territories and attempt to eradicate Indigenous nations across the continent for the following century. Illegal squatter-settlers, always with practiced Indian killers in the lead, initially depended on colonial militias for support; after the War of Independence they relied on the U.S. military to protect their settlements. During the war years of 1774–83, the secessionists’ parallel wars against Native nations were, in military historian John Grenier’s words, “waypoints in the development of the first way of war. In them, we find the same elements—necessity and efficiency, the uncontrollable momentum of extravagant violence, and the quest for the subjugation of Indians—that had defined the first way of war throughout the colonial period.”

In a book first published in 1876 but written decades earlier, historian Joseph Doddridge (1769–1826), a minister and early settler in the Ohio country, wrote:

The early settlers on the frontiers of this country were like Arabs of the desert of Africa, in at least two respects; every man was a soldier, and from early in the spring till late in the fall, was almost continually in arms. Their work was often carried on by parties, each one of whom had his rifle and everything else belonging to his wardress. These were deposited in some central place in the field. A sentinel was stationed on the outside of the fence, so that on the least alarm the whole company repaired to their arms, and were ready for combat in a moment.

“Militant settlers—‘rangers’—created the framework for the United States to appropriate Native territories and attempt to eradicate Indigenous nations across the continent.”

The Second Amendment thus reflects this dependence on individual armed men, not just in terms of a right to bear arms, but also as a requirement to bear arms, which was crucial to the integrity of the state and the conception of security achieved through a relationship between state and citizen. In 1783, the British withdrew from the fight to maintain sovereignty over their thirteen colonies, not due to military defeat, but rather in order to redirect their resources to occupy and colonize South Asia. Britain’s transfer of its claim to Indian Country west of the colonies spelled a nightmarish disaster for all Indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi, and ultimately all of North America that would be claimed and occupied by the United States. Britain’s withdrawal in 1783 opened a new chapter of unrestrained racist violence and colonization of the continent.

The creation of the U.S. Constitution began in 1785, but the document was not approved by all the states and in effect until 1791. Meanwhile, the interim Continental Congress got to work on a plan for colonization over the mountain range. The Land Ordinance of 1785 established a centralized system for surveying and distributing land, with seized Native lands being auctioned off to the highest bidder. The “Northwest” (referring to the Ohio country) Ordinance of 1787 set forth a colonization procedure for annexation via military occupation, transforming to civilian territorial status under federal control, and, finally, statehood. These were the first laws of the incipient republic, revealing the motive for those desiring independence. It was the blueprint for the taking of the North American continent, with lines of future settlement reaching the Pacific on the maps. The maps contained in the land ordinances, which laid out land in marketable square-mile plots, were not new; they were the products of pre-Revolutionary colonial elites, including George Washington, who as leader of the Virginia militia took armed surveying teams illegally into Ohio country, making him one of the most successful land speculators in the colonies. The wealthiest colonists were all speculators; acquiring land and enslaving people provided the very basis of the economy of the first nation born as a capitalist state, and by 1850, it was the wealthiest economy in the world.

In 1801, President Thomas Jefferson aptly described the new settler-state’s intentions for horizontal and vertical continental expansion as an “empire for liberty,” stating: “However our present interests may restrain us within our own limits, it is impossible not to look forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent, with a people speaking the same language, governed in similar form by similar laws.” This vision of Manifest Destiny found form a few years later in the Monroe Doctrine, signaling the intention of annexing or dominating former Spanish colonial territories in the Americas and the Pacific, which would be put into practice during the rest of the century, while carrying out brutal wars of extermination and expulsion of Native peoples to complete the continental shape of the United States today.

“Britain’s transfer of its claim to Indian Country west of the colonies spelled a nightmarish disaster for all Indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi, and ultimately all of North America.”

Taking land by force was not an accidental or spontaneous project or the work of a few rogue characters. The violent appropriation of Native land by white settlers was seen as an individual right in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, second only to freedom of speech. Male colonial settlers had long formed militias for the purpose of raiding and razing Indigenous communities and seizing their lands and resources, and the Native communities fought back. Virginia, the first colony, forbade any man to travel unless he was “well armed.” A few years later, another law required men to take arms with them to work and to attend church or be fined. In 1658, the colony ordered every settler home to have a functioning firearm, and later even provided government loans for those who could not afford to buy a weapon. Similarly, New England colonial governments made laws such as the 1632 requirement that each person have a functioning firearm plus two pounds of gunpowder and ten pounds of bullets. Householders were fined for missing or defective arms and ammunition. No man was to appear at a public meeting unarmed.4

These laws stayed on the books of the earliest colonies and were created in new colonies as they were founded. The Second Amendment, ratified in 1791, enshrined these obligations as constitutional law: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The continuing significance of that “freedom” specified in the Bill of Rights reveals the settler-colonialist cultural roots of the United States that appear even in the present as a sacred right. Several of the colonies that declared independence in 1776—Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia—had already adopted individual gun rights measures into their state constitutions before the Second Amendment was passed at the federal level.

Settler-militias and armed households were institutionalized for the destruction and control of Native peoples, communities, and nations. With the expansion of plantation agriculture, by the late 1600s they were also used as “slave patrols,” forming the basis of the U.S. police culture after enslaving people was illegalized. That is the inseparable other half of the settler-colonial reality that is implicit in the Second Amendment. The first enslaved Africans to be shipped to Britain’s first colony of the eventual thirteen colonies that became the United States took place in 1619, when twenty bonded Africans arrived in Virginia. Most of the labor being used in the first decade of the colony was made up of British and other Europeans who had indentured themselves for varying lengths of time, but African slavery was different. As Howard Zinn points out: “Some historians think those first blacks in Virginia were considered as servants, like the white indentured servants brought from Europe. But the strong probability is that, even if they were listed as ‘servants’ (a more familiar category to the English), they were viewed as being different from white servants, were treated differently, and in fact were slaves.”

“George Washington took armed surveying teams illegally into Ohio country, making him one of the most successful land speculators in the colonies.”

Other scholars have presumed that the British settlers in North America were reluctant to enslave Africans, but that too seems a spurious notion. When the Doctrine of Discovery promulgated by the Vatican in the mid-fifteenth century “legalized” the Portuguese capture and enslavement of the people of West Africa, the trans-Atlantic slave trade took off, first within European markets. Then, in 1492, it reached the Caribbean, and had been in effect for over a century when the Virginia seaboard was wrenched from the Indigenous farmers by English usurpers. From the mid-fifteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, most of the non-European world was colonized under the Doctrine of Discovery, one of the first principles of international law promulgated by Christian European monarchies to legitimize investigating, mapping, and claiming lands belonging to peoples outside Europe. It originated in a papal bull issued in 1455 that permitted the Portuguese monarchy to seize West Africa for enslaving those who lived there. Following Columbus’s infamous exploratory voyage in 1492, sponsored by the king and queen of the infant Spanish state, another papal bull extended similar permission to Spain. Disputes between the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies led to the papal-initiated Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), which, besides dividing the globe equally between the two Iberian empires, clarified that only non-Christian lands fell under the discovery doctrine.

This doctrine, on which all European states relied, thus originated with the arbitrary and unilateral establishment of the Iberian monarchies’ exclusive rights under Christian canon law to colonize, enslave, and exterminate foreign peoples, and these were later embraced by other European monarchical colonizing projects, such as the British in North America.

The only barrier to introducing slavery in Virginia and all the other colonies would have been economic, not ethical. The Southern colonies emerged in territory that had been one of seven original birthplaces of agriculture in the world tens of thousands of years before, developed by the Muskogee and other Indigenous agricultural societies. Appropriated by European settlers, these lands would become economies based on enslaved African labor and increasingly on breeding enslaved people for profit, with the Indigenous farmers forced to the peripheries. At the time of U.S. independence, half the population of South Carolina was made up of enslaved Africans, with the other agribusiness colonies having large enslaved populations as well. By the late seventeenth century, onerous slave codes had been developed, which included mandatory slave patrols drawn from the already existing militias.

“New England colonial governments made laws such as the 1632 requirement that each person have a functioning firearm plus two pounds of gunpowder and ten pounds of bullets.”

The wealthy slavers of the Southern colonies, particularly those in Virginia, were most incensed by the British Proclamation following the French and Indian War prohibiting expansion over the Appalachian ridge, since their wealth relied on accessing more and more land as they depleted the soils with intensive monocrop production for the market. They defied the Proclamation, taking survey teams into the Ohio country to map the territory for future settlement, which by definition meant the extension and expansion of slavery. By the time he was in his mid-twenties, George Washington was already a notoriously successful slaver and land speculator in unceded Indian lands.

Washington and the other founders of the United States designed a governmental and economic structure to serve the private property interests of each and all of the primary actors, nearly all of them slavers and land speculators, with the brilliant Alexander Hamilton as the genius of finance. Like the Indian-killing militias that continued and intensified as the United States appropriated more land for slavers, slave patrols grew accordingly. The ethnic cleansing of Native Americans complete, slavers—with their reserve of capital and enslaved labor—transformed the Mississippi Valley into the Cotton Kingdom that formed the basis for U.S. capitalism and world trade. In the words of Harvard historian Walter Johnson: “The extension of slavery into the Mississippi Valley gave an institution that was in decline at the end of the eighteenth century new life in the nineteenth. In 1800, there were around 100,000 slaves living within the boundaries of the present-day states of Mississippi and Louisiana; in 1840, there were more than 250,000; in 1860, more than 750,000.”9

The militaristic-capitalist powerhouse that the United States became by 1840 derived from real estate (which included enslaved Africans, as well as appropriated land). The United States was founded as a capitalist state and an empire on conquered land, with capital in the form of slaves, hence the term chattel slavery; this was exceptional in the world and has remained exceptional. The capitalist firearms industry was among the first successful modern corporations. Gun proliferation and gun violence today are among its legacies.

The Boston Celtics are traveling out to the west coast to battle it out with their longtime rival LA Lakers. The rivalry dates back to the days of Magic vs. Bird and has only grown with Kobe vs. the Big 3. Now its time to start a new era in the Lakers Celtics rivalry with names like Irving, Tatum, Ball, and Ingram. This is a prove ’em game for the Lakers who are on a hot streak winning two in a row and adding another big W against the C’s could do wonders moving forward. The Celtics are trying to snap out of a funk themselves, and a nice win in LA might do just to trick.

The Boston Celtics (34-13) are currently on a three-game losing streak as they fly into the Staples Center. The Celtics are coming off a four-game home stand where they went 1-3, so this west coast trip will do a lot for how they finish this first half of the season. Boston is lead by Kyrie Irving who’s having himself one heck of season averaging 24.5 points! Al Horford is low key been leading the Celtics in assists, rebounds, and steals per game, both of them are going to have to show up to beat the Lakers.

The Los Angeles Lakers (17-29) are fresh off their second win in a row and 5th straight at home after blowing out the Knicks by 20! The Lakers might be without 2nd overall pick Lonzo Ball for this one; Ball leads the team with 7.1 assists and rebound per game. Lucky for the Lakers they will be with their top two scorers with Kyle Kuzman and Brandon Ingram who are averaging 16.4 and 15.7 points per game respectively. Luke Walton is trying his best to win with an extremely young roster with the only true veteran being Brook Lopez who has brought excellent leadership to the team. The Lakers future is bright, and they want to show the Celtics that they aren’t going to be in the cellar of the league for long.

Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen has continuously tried to blame the media and their “false narrative” and has consistently denied there was any sexual relationship. However, it’s really hard to believe that especially when Cohen attempted to pay Clifford in the most shadiest of ways.

The Wall Street Journal reported that not only was Clifford paid $130,000, but she was paid through a company that was created shortly before election day in 2016.

‘The lawyer, Michael Cohen, established Essential Consultants LLC, on Oct. 17, 2016, just before the 2016 presidential election, corporate documents show. Mr. Cohen, who is based in New York, then used a bank account linked to the entity to send the payment to the client-trust account of a lawyer representing the woman, Stephanie Clifford, one of the people said.’

There are several things about this transaction that are curious. Looking at the timing of the transaction, it’s obvious it was paid at a precarious time for the Trump campaign. Trump’s campaign had weathered several scandals including the Access Hollywood scandal. Trump didn’t need another one, so a payment of $130,000 from Trump would make sense.

Now, the Wall Street Journal notes something very important. Cohen was based in New York; however, he opened a business in Delaware. Why? According to WSJ, Delaware does not require the names of managers of businesses to be disclosed. They wrote:

‘Mr. Cohen’s decision to establish the company in Delaware offered him privacy and simplicity, hallmarks of a state that has attracted more than one million business entities.’

So, finding Cohen’s ties to the company would not be easily done. However, Cohen did put himself down as an “authorized person” for Essential Consultants LLC, so his name showed up on the formation documents.

Why would anyone pay $130,000 to someone through a fake company in a state that protects the identities of business owners for any other reason than a bribe to keep silent? There’s literally no other explanation to give.

Funnily enough, Cohen has not said very much about the actual payment. However, he has denied there was ever any sexual relationship between Trump and Clifford.

‘In emails to the Journal last week, Mr. Cohen didn’t address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that “President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has” Ms. Clifford. He also declined to discuss Essential Consultants, and asked the Journal to “cease wasting my time.”‘

Cohen and the Trump administration can deny the allegations until they are blue in the face. However, it’s too shady of a deal.

Trump would never pay someone $130,000 just for the hell of it. He’s bragged about never settling in court. He would only make such a deal if he had something important to gain from it. Buying Clifford’s silence would be beyond important. Anyone with a drop of common sense can see right through the sham they are presenting to the American people.

But for children, it can be so much worse. The life-threatening illness makes children contemplate their own mortality. And while this can inspire people to seize life while they have it, it can also be very depressing. But when people step up to the challenge and do everything they can to battle cancer and WIN, then they can face life with a whole new kind of courage and bravery. And that’s what happened to Gunner Miller.

After cancer put this rising football star on the sidelines for two years, his father, who also happened to be the high school football coach, decided to put Gunner back in the game for the first time since he started fighting cancer. And Gunner was there to play the final snap of the team’s championship game.

Ever since doctors told Gunner he had Ewing’s Sarcoma back in 2015, he has been getting treated and was too weakened from the rare type of cancer of his bones to play football.

Gunner’s energy was spent enduring hours of therapy and rehab throughout most of 2015 and 2016. And as a result, Gunner was not allowed to play football for those seasons. Only on Thursday, a few days before Christmas 2017 did his father allow him to suit up and play during the high school’s biggest game of the season. They were matched up against their rivals Brock High School and were playing for the Class 3A Division I title game. The stakes were high, and Gunner wanted to win.

Gunner went into remission in August after he had surgery to remove a tumor.

His father, who coaches the team, did not want his son in the game. But Gunner’s teammates demanded that he play.

“It wasn’t even my idea. It was his teammates’ idea,” Jeff Miller told the Telegram following the game. “They came up to me and said, ‘Hey, would you be willing to do this?’ They didn’t have to ask me twice.”

Brock High was destroying Gunner’s team. They had taken a 21-0 lead after just one quarter. But Rockdale climbed back and scored four touchdowns to go into halftime 21-28.

And as Gunner stepped in for the final play, he helped ensure they were victorious. In the end, the Rockdale Tigers were crowned football state champions for the first time in four decades.

Gunner took a knee to win the game.

“We’ve dealt with adversity for so long and so often that we know a football game, a football season and life are going to be rough on you sometimes,” Jeff Miller said as he wept.

With the championship won, the Millers celebrated Christmas with their family in Texas.

Some MailOnline readers shared their thoughts about Gunner’s victory.

“There it is. The ONLY time a player should take a knee at a football game.”

“This is what team sports are really about. Building strength of both body and character. My Dad used to coach Boxing, and would have been in tears too if that were me.”

You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.

For many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.

The potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.

What did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!

The ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.

In total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.

Perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Church Congregation Brings Gift to Waitresses Working on Christmas Eve, Has Them Crying (video)",Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,
118,142,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/brain-injury-victim-whos-been-comatose-since-1996-gives-mom-unexplainable-christmas-miracle/,"One of the worst things that a mother can face, is having an ill or severely disabled child. When Joellan Huntley was just 15-years-old, she was in a car accident that left her with a catastrophic brain injury. Having been thrown from a car that swerved to avoid a loose dog running along a road in Centreville, Nova Scotia, Joellan suffered traumatic injuries. In that same accident, her boyfriend and a young girl who was the sister of the driver were killed.

As a result of the crash, Joellan’s family won a $1 million settlement, however; by 2014 the family was in a battle with the province’s Community Services Department, which was on a mission to get the money back for past and future costs of care. The result of the battle was a settlement that gave the family funds for physiotherapy and equipment that would add to Joellan’s quality of life.

Since 1996, her mother, Louise Misner, hasn’t been able to have the luxury of having a conversation of her daughter, and the now 37-year-old has spent most of her life unable to walk or talk and she’s been fed through a tube.

While Joellan was able to make sounds to respond to family members, she was unable to communicate any thoughts…until now. Thanks to technology equipment that she recently received, Joellan is able to communicate with her mom via eye motion cameras and software on an iPad. And the best part is that all of this happened on Christmas day, proving that Christmas miracles really do exist for the Nova Scotia family.

It happened when Louise was visiting Joellan at the Kings Regional Rehabilitation Center in Waterville, Nova Scotia.

What seems like a basic conversation between mother and daughter, turned out to be a miracle. Louise had told Joellan that she liked the Christmas outfit that she was wearing. Joellan then used the technology to find an icon for a long-sleeve shirt to respond to her mom.

“Christmas miracle,” said Louise, who had been longing for this exchange for years. “It was God’s way of telling me that she’s finally achieved what she needed to since the accident.”

According to Joellan’s nurses, she is doing well with the new communication system.

“We had to go through two or three different screens until we found the right one for her and it’s called Eyegaze,” said Louise. “Her eyes focus on the icons to answer questions. I knew she just needed time for technology to catch up with her. When God gives you a child, they are the most precious thing and you never give up on them and you always fight for them.”

We take for granted the simple things that most of us are able to do on a daily basis…like have a conversation with a parent or a child. Unfortunately, there are people who don’t have that privilege. Luckily technology is moving forward at a rapid pace and hopefully, life will only get easier for Joellan and her family. They’ve certainly been through enough already.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Brain Injury Victim Who’s Been Comatose Since 1996 Gives Mom Unexplainable Christmas Miracle,Kate Anslinger,,[''],,,,

Advertisers are so gifted that they can even make you think that drinking alcohol is healthy and will make you more successful in both the bedroom and the office.When it comes to advertising, it’s all about the image. It’s for this reason that billboards across America show a sexy woman drinking a martini or a glass of wine, eluding to the fact that she booze will give her liquid courage and make her appear like she’s got it all together.

The same goes for those old-school cigarette commercials. Remember when they made it look like you’d instantly transform into a strong and healthy cowboy. Considering smokers are much more likely to lose their lives to lung cancer, then these ads are far from believable.

A similar trick of the eye scheme was exposed at a fast food restaurant recently, and it was all caught on camera. When one clever person realized that the unknown restaurant was selling three different sized beverages, that were essentially the same size, they decided to film it and show the world exactly how the soda fit into the small, medium and large sizes. Yet, the company was selling them for three different prices, the largest one costing the most amount of money of course.

In the video, you can see that the three cups are all shaped different, yet they give the appearance that the large is the tallest of the three, as to be expected. But if you look closely, the largest cup has a very narrow bottom, making it appear that it is tall but it is actually very thin at the bottom. The smallest cup appears to be very similar to the medium sized cup, however; it must be a tad wider than the medium cup in order to fit the same amount.

In any event, if you are a lover of fast food, then you should beware of this type of scam. These restaurants are probably making loads of dough all because of this little trick of the eye. Be smarter than them and ask to see the cups up close before you make a purchase and decide on a drink size. It may be in your best interest to always pay for a small cup, considering it’s essentially the exact same size as the large for the same amount of money. Or, you can really be sure and purchase yourself a bottle of soda at a nearby convenience store.

There is a good chance that restaurants are doing this type of advertising with their other products as well. Maybe that super-sized meal isn’t as super-sized as you thought it was. As they say….looks can be deceiving. Sometimes it’s best to do your homework when it comes to sizes and prices at restaurants before you fork over your hard-earned cash.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Guy Exposes Scam Popular Restaurant Pulls On Millions Of People A Year (video),Kate Anslinger,,[''],,,,

Republicans swear it’s fake news. Democrats assert it’s proof that an investigation into Trump’s wheelings and dealings is called for.

When Fusion GPS owner, Glenn Simpson, testified before the House Intelligence Committee, he made some serious allegations. Thanks to the release of the transcript by House Democrats, we’re getting a look at those allegations, and they are indeed serious.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein also released the Senate transcript of their interview with Simpson.

The most serious allegation appears to be the allegation that Trump conducted several business deals that appeared to researchers as Russian money laundering.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) asked Simpson about how the Russians launder money and if he found any evidence of money laundering through Trump. Simpson answered:

‘I think a lot of what we found is subsequently – there have been similar articles published. “Evidence,” I think we saw patterns of buying and selling that we thought were suggestive of money laundering.’

Simpson went on to explain that, as researchers, they notice patterns that indicate money laundering, which included the buying and selling of real estate.

He then presented several facts that seem to support the allegation that Russia was laundering money through Trump. Simpson described a Russian gangster, who went by Taiwanchik, who either lived in Trump Tower or had his associates living in Trump Tower.

‘We had a gangster named Taiwanchik living in Trump Tower who had been under — I’m sorry, he was — I think he was running a — his associates were living in Trump Tower, and he was running a high-stakes gambling ring out of Trump Tower, while he himself was a fugitive for having rigged the skating competition at the Salt Lake Olympics and a bunch of other sporting events engaged in rigging.’

Furthermore, Simpson noted this Russian gangster attended Trump’s Miss Universe pageant in 2013 and sat in the VIP section alongside Trump and other Kremlin officials.

Interestingly enough, Preet Bharara was prosecuting a case against Taiwanchik. Bharara was fired by Trump in 2017.

He noted that the patterns they noticed that suggested money laundering were quick deals made by individuals who attempted to veil their identity. Those deals were a decade ago.

However, Simpson also noted there were still existing projects that reeked of fraud.

‘… Specifically a project in Panama, the one in Toronto. Those both got a lot of fraud associated with them, a lot of fraud allegations, a lot of activity that I would say smacks of fraud, and a lot of Russian mafia figures listed as buyers who may or may not have actually put money into it.’

Researchers were also concerned about Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland. You know, the golf courses Trump is always bragging about. Simpson noted that hundreds of millions of dollars came in from unknown sources, and Eric Trump once bragged about having unlimited amounts of money available for their golf course projects.

Hilariously, he went on to say his research suggested Trump was really not a billionaire and couldn’t do the things he’s bragged about doing.

‘So, you know, if you’re familiar with Donald Trump’s finances and the litigation over whether he’s really a billionaire, you know, there’s good reason to believe he doesn’t have enough money to do this and that he would have had to have outside financial support for these things.’

The 165-page document goes on to reveal more serious allegations. What it does provide though is further proof an in-depth investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia must continue. If there was no collusion to swing the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor, there is still a massive amount of findings that suggest Trump worked with Russians in a money laundering scheme.

Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen has continuously tried to blame the media and their “false narrative” and has consistently denied there was any sexual relationship. However, it’s really hard to believe that especially when Cohen attempted to pay Clifford in the most shadiest of ways.

The Wall Street Journal reported that not only was Clifford paid $130,000, but she was paid through a company that was created shortly before election day in 2016.

‘The lawyer, Michael Cohen, established Essential Consultants LLC, on Oct. 17, 2016, just before the 2016 presidential election, corporate documents show. Mr. Cohen, who is based in New York, then used a bank account linked to the entity to send the payment to the client-trust account of a lawyer representing the woman, Stephanie Clifford, one of the people said.’

There are several things about this transaction that are curious. Looking at the timing of the transaction, it’s obvious it was paid at a precarious time for the Trump campaign. Trump’s campaign had weathered several scandals including the Access Hollywood scandal. Trump didn’t need another one, so a payment of $130,000 from Trump would make sense.

Now, the Wall Street Journal notes something very important. Cohen was based in New York; however, he opened a business in Delaware. Why? According to WSJ, Delaware does not require the names of managers of businesses to be disclosed. They wrote:

123,147,clickhole.com,satire,http://www.clickhole.com/article/id-love-work-keegan-again-not-comedy-partner-sears-7278,"Making his directorial debut with the critically acclaimed film ‘Get Out,’ Jordan Peele has announced himself as a force to be reckoned with in an industry where directors of color are rarely given a chance to shine. From his early days as a sketch comedian to his recent Oscar nomination, we sat down with the 38-year-old to discuss his career, life, and newfound success.

1. You released your first feature film this year, Get Out. Were you surprised by all the critical acclaim it got?

To be perfectly honest, I was very surprised! First and foremost, Get Out is all just an allegory for the 1987 World Series. The main character is the Minnesota Twins, his white girlfriend is the St. Louis Cardinals, and racism is baseball. Also the deer is the infield fly rule. I’m just glad people got that.

2. You first made it big on Key & Peele with your longtime comedy partner Keegan-Michael Key. What was your experience working with him on the show?

Keegan and I compliment each other really well. Keegan actually went blind from looking at porn, and I became completely deaf from working as an SAT tutor at a gun range. After we met, we knew we had something special, so we just started filming it. That’s how the Obama anger-translator sketch was born.

3. You left Key & Peele behind to try to make Get Out. What was that process like early on?

It was tough because when I first told Keegan what I wanted to do, he assumed we’d be doing the horror stuff together and started pitching me some of the shittiest scary movie ideas I’ve ever heard. It was heartbreaking. Whether it was, “Our movie will basically be Halloween except Mike Myers will only kill one horse by accident,” or just a detail that he thought was scary like, “a big-ass horse dying by accident near some ocean without leaving any clues,” it was all a nightmare to listen to.

4. Your wife, Chelsea Peretti, is also a comedian. How do you avoid competing with each other?

Every morning we challenge each other to write the best joke about the Vietnam War to determine who’s funnier. Chelsea always wins because of her vast knowledge of the effects of Agent Orange.

5. Do you plan to continue working with Keegan-Michael Key?

Not as a comedy partner, but we might, like, work together at Sears or something.

Sitting atop both lists were two liberal icons, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, respectively. Obama and Clinton have had long runs at the number one spot, but among the celebrities and politicians who made it on the list were notable Republicans.

Donald Trump was the number two most admired man. The president was joined by Republicans John McCain and Mike Pence on the list, along with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

However, it was the list of most popular women in the world that raised some eyebrows. Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama were number one and number two on the list but three notable Republican women made it into the top 10.

7. Condoleezza Rice

8. Melania Trump

9. Nikki Haley

These three beat out Beyoncé and Kate Middleton.

Gallup goes on to note that while Obama and Hillary have had the top spots for years, their popularity has taken a big hit.

Clinton’s and Obama’s standings this year are more tenuous than in the past. The 9% who name Clinton is the lowest percentage she has received since 2002, when 7% named her in another close first-place finish. Clinton won the title this year in the same poll she registered a personal low favorable rating.

This indicates she remains top of mind for enough people who like her to be named more than any other woman in response to the open-ended question, finishing ahead of some women who may be better liked overall but are not as prominent in people’s minds. The percentage of adults naming Obama as the most admired man is down from 22% last year, but he has been at or near 17% in several other years.

Trump held a brief avail with the press in the Oval Office Tuesday afternoon while meeting with President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.

Trump touted economic achievement over the last couple months of his administration, noting the historically low black unemployment numbers and the return of manufacturing jobs.

After the comments, Trump thanked the press for being there. As staffers asked the press to leave the Oval Office, a barrage of questions were shouted at the president. Many were shouted by CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. Acosta loudly asked about Norway and Steve Bannon, causing the White House staff to reprimand him with a quick ” Jim, thank you. Please exit. Thanks, everyone.”

Trump, for his part, had a one word response to Acosta’s questioning: “Out.”

Acosta tweeted after being forced out that staff were yelling at him:

Trump was not initially supposed to receive a cognitive exam during his first presidential trip to the doctor, but Dr. Jackson said that Trump specifically requested the exam himself.

There’s no denying the date of Australia Day is a controversial subject for all that call the island nation home. In a bold yet completely predictable move that has angered many, radio station triple j decided to move their iconic Hottest 100 countdown from Australia Day to the fourth Saturday of January.

One man staunch in his beliefs the date should remain is refrigeration specialist Jordan Freeman (36) who says he will be boycotting the Hottest 100, a daring move considering he only listens to Pantera.

Freeman insists that changing the date of the countdown is a sign of crude disrespect, which is why he will be listening to songs such as ‘Psycho Holiday,’ ‘Slaughtered’ and ‘Suicide Note Pt II’ instead.

“I won’t be listening to triple j because that’s denying our history when you change the date. Pantera doesn’t deny any history. Have you seen the amount of Confederate flags at their concerts?”

According to Freeman, it is people like him who will lead to the radio stations downfall, even though they haven’t listened to the station since high school, they aren’t afraid to share their opinion online using a skeleton giving an obscene hand gesture as their photo.

Although Freeman admits he has not given the radio station a good listen since they stopped playing songs from A Vulgar Display of Power, his boycott will still have some effect as he spends Australia Day in his garage jamming out with his mates who all have matching ‘RIP Dimebag’ tattoos.

A bloke that everyone just assumed would glide into a professional sporting career, or some other role that demanded respect from nerds, has actually proven that high school social status is so very very irrelevant in the greater scheme of thing.

At 28, the once legendary bully named Michael Harby who had the hottest girlfriend who he used to cheat on, is actually at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to post school performances.

And ironically, he can’t make through to lunch without smoking a huge cone.

Now, between fleeting work throwing shit into a skip bin and hundreds of chances working for his old man – he couldn’t be more of a fuck up. It’s so funny.

In fact the highlight of Michael’s life so far has been briefly thinking he had knocked up a chick from the local leagues club accidentally.

January 24, 2018

California residents celebrated New Year's with the state legalizing ""recreational marijuana."" State and local politicians were thinking of ways to spend the enhanced tax revenue they will receive. Thousands of Marijuana shop business license applications were submitted for approval. Everything will now be wonderful. People will start being nice to each other again, the sun will shine, and everything will be groovy. What could go wrong?

Before you could say, ""contact high,"" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he was revoking an Obama era Department of Justice Memo that instructed its U.S. Attorneys to not enforce federal marijuana laws in those states that had legalized the drug for medicinal use. Ah, bummer, dude.

Not only has California defied the federal government by declaring itself a ""Sanctuary State"" for illegal aliens, now it's legalizing recreational marijuana! I can hear AG Sessions at a staff meeting declaring, ""California, here we come.""

For anyone considering investing in or opening a recreational marijuana business, I have a question: Ever hear of federal civil and criminal forfeiture laws? If AG Sessions proceeds with unleashing DEA in states that legalized the cultivation, possession, sale, and use of marijuana, it could be a rapid end to this budding enterprise (pun intended).

All real property, proceeds, equipment, vehicles, cash, and other assets gained from marijuana sales or used to facilitate marijuana dispensaries are subject to civil or criminal forfeiture. If the government can show that the owner of a building knew he was renting it to a marijuana business, the building would be subject to forfeiture. Think that might deter a landlord from leasing his building to a pot business? Obviously, if a weed business owner buys his own building, it would be subject to forfeiture also. The rush to purchase otherwise useless land for the thousands of marijuana ""farms"" cropping up in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Colorado and other states is also subject to forfeiture. I will go so far as to say that any tax money received by state and local governments is also subject to civil forfeiture, including anything purchased with the tax money. Need a slightly used fire engine?

State and local governments need to sober up and face reality. It is still a federal crime to grow, possess, and distribute Marijuana, a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substance Act. They need to realize that any additional money in taxes they receive could easily be spent on drug rehabilitation programs, increased fatal drugged driving collisions, industrial accidents, civil litigation and the like.

Know what a conspiracy is? It's when two or more people agree to commit a crime, like selling marijuana. It doesn't matter what someone's role in the conspiracy was, the fact you're involved makes you liable for the future crimes of all the other members of the conspiracy the moment you join it. Anyone who tends a marijuana farm, drives the weed to the dispensaries, fills the shelves with jars of marijuana, waits on customers, sweeps the floor, makes cash bank deposits or does anything else to facilitate the sale of marijuana is guilty of conspiracy in addition to the actual possession and sale of marijuana. A city official who issues a marijuana dispensary business license could also fall in that category.

Is this farfetched? AG Sessions has expressed lots of anti-marijuana sentiments. He's irritated at California for not cooperating with federal immigration officials. He has a law and order president who wants to end the opioid epidemic and probably believes that marijuana is a gateway drug to heroin use.

So, is now the time to invest in the lucrative marijuana business in California and elsewhere? I don't think so.

132,156,wnd.com,bias,http://www.wnd.com/2018/01/biggest-pro-life-goal-defunding-abortionists/,"Lila Rose, president of the pro-life group Live Action, says President Trump is off to a “promising” start on pro-life issues, but she says the president and Congress must do what it takes to defund Planned Parenthood at a time when Democrats are voting in favor of “infanticide.”

Still in her 20s, Rose has been a leading pro-life activist for a decade, starting when she was 15. She gained notoriety for videotaping her experiences posing as a pregnant teenager at various Planned Parenthood facilities.

One year into the Trump presidency and 45 years since the Supreme Court legalized abortion, Rose gives the administration a decent grade on pro-life issues.

“I think the last year has been promising. I would use that word, especially the folks that he’s surrounded himself with, and the appointments he’s made, and the confirming of Justice Gorsuch. These are good signs,” said Rose.

“I think it’s good that he showed up to speak from the Rose Garden at the March for Life. I think his appointments are good on [Health and Human Services]. The head of the Department of Justice is now investigating Planned Parenthood. These are good things, but we really have to achieve the biggest thing, which is stopping the government forcing of taxpayers to fund abortion chains,” said Rose.

“We are urging to administration to really lean on Congress to make sure they get that bill to ensure that we’re not funding the biggest abortion chain (Planned Parenthood) $1.5 million every day,” added Rose.

Republicans did try to include defunding of Planned Parenthood in various forms of Obamacare repeal or reform legislation, only to be thwarted by the likes of Republican Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

Rose worries Congress members may be more eager to promise defunding Planned Parenthood than to actually do it.

“I am concerned about lip service and I think others in the movement are concerned. This is a really hard thing to do. You basically have to break 50 votes. Depending on how the rules are changed or amended, you could get the vice president to weigh in and be the tiebreaker in the Senate.

“There is a path to do it. It’s a matter of is this going to be the most important thing for the administration when it comes to upholding the first human right and protecting human life in this country,” said Rose.

The interview:

While Rose and other pro-life activists pressure lawmakers to make defunding Planned Parenthood a priority, she is appalled by how Democrats approached Friday’s House vote on the Born Alive Infant Protection Act.

The legislation would require medical personnel to do whatever is possible to save the life of a baby if he or she emerges alive from the mother’s womb following an attempted abortion. It reinforces existing policy but also adds criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison for failing to pursue life-saving measures.

The bill passed, with all Republicans voting for it, but 183 of 189 Democrats opposed it.

Planned Parenthood denounced the bill.

“Medical guidelines and ethics already compel physicians facing life-threatening circumstances to respond. Doctors and clinicians oppose this law because it prevents them from giving the best care to their patients. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly opposes this legislation, calling it a ‘gross interference in the practice of medicine,'” said a Planned Parenthood statement.

Planned Parenthood official Dana Singiser took it even further.

“The political agenda here is clear: to take away access to safe, legal abortion,” said Singiser in the same statement.

But Rose says the vote just shows how radical Democrats are on abortion now.

“I think it just shows the insanity of the Democratic Party today, which is really going to hurt them in elections the more word gets out. This bill, the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, wasn’t even about abortion. It was about infanticide. It was about protecting children who have been born and who deserve to be protected,” said Rose.

“The fact that Democrats in a huge voting bloc, tried to reject a bill that would protect against infanticide is extremely troubling. Look, most of the electorate – including in the Democratic Party – want at least some restrictions on abortion. That’s the majority of Democrats, including Democrat women,” said Rose.

Rose says Democrats are increasingly marching to whatever tune Planned Parenthood is playing.

“They help elect these people so even though these folks try to mislead voters to say that they were more moderate or they cared about human rights or do what was best once in office, their elections are being funded by Planned Parenthood.

“They’re going to march to the beat of their drum, even if that beat ultimately includes shooting down protections against infanticide,” said Rose.

One of the major themes at Friday’s March for Life was how science is on the side of the pro-life movement, especially with the advancements in ultrasound technology. Rose says the assertions that life begins at birth or that viability should determine personhood are relics.

“If you create an arbitrary line at birth, then you are killing children who are viable before birth, children that are separated by inches of a birth canal from human rights protections. It’s arbitrary. It doesn’t make sense,” said Rose.

And she says science changing beliefs about viability as well.

“Viability is being increasingly moved backwards. Children can now survive outside the womb with medical assistance a little past 21 weeks. That’s incredible. The more we develop our medical technology, the more and more that viability line will change. People are realizing it’s an arbitrary line and that life, as science reveals, begins at the moment of conception,” said Rose.

Rose says the pro-life movement has a lot of momentum both politically and to some extent in the courts. However, she contends Congress needs to seize the momentum and end taxpayer subsidies for Planned Parenthood to be a true success.

She also claims cultural momentum, pointing out that more Americans are pro-life, and young people a major reason why. Rose also says the personal stories of mothers who carry difficult pregnancies to term and the testimonies of former abortion clinic workers are changing minds around the nation.

134,158,wnd.com,bias,http://www.wnd.com/2017/09/protesters-against-black-genocide-of-abortion-win-case/print/,"Two black leaders who were prevented from demonstrating outside the Smithsonian African-American history museum against a decades-long “genocide” carried out against black children through abortion resolved a free-speech case against the federal government in their favor.

Rev. Clenard H. Childress Jr., pastor of a black church in the Newark, New Jersey, area, and Jacqueline Hawkins, director minority outreach for the non-profit Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, filed suit after an official with the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and uniformed police officers from the Office of Protection Services told them they could not stand outside the museum with their sign.

The protest in February was part of a project by the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, or CBR, that uses photo-mural exhibits and literature to “demonstrate the devastation of abortion’s consequences on the African American community.”

The parties filed a settlement Aug. 30 in which the federal government formally acknowledged “that the public sidewalks forming the perimeter of the National Museum of African American History and Culture are available for First Amendment activity.” The government also agreed to pay attorney’s fees to the nonprofit American Freedom Law Center, which represented the protesters.

Robert Muise, AFLC co-founder and senior counsel, said there was “no question that our clients had a clear right under the First Amendment to engage in their peaceful, non-obstructive free speech activity on the public sidewalks outside of this museum.”

“The government was wrong for denying our clients that right, and they knew it,” he said.

The other plaintiffs in the lawsuit were CBR and its executive director, Gregg Cunningham, who was standing by during the incident.

Childress and Hawkins, who direct the CBR project targeting the history museum, testified that when they were told they could not stand outside the museum with their sign, Childress responded that they were on a public sidewalk.

The senior OPS officer warned the two that if they did not move to a remote location across the street, he and his fellow officers would physically move them. The officer also warned that they would be subject to arrest.

Rather than face arrest or physical force, Childress and Hawkins followed the officer’s order.

In June, AFLC filed a federal lawsuit in federal court in Washington against the museum, OPS and several federal officials.

Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, the Justice Department contacted AFLC attorneys, who confirmed the protesters’ First Amendment rights and stated the federal government wanted to settle the case.

David Yerushalmi, AFLC co-founder and senior counsel, asserted that in addition to being “a gross violation of our clients’ fundamental rights, the actions of the museum officials and their armed security demonstrate the hypocrisy of the left.”

“Progressives claim to be for diversity and tolerance, but if you don’t march in lockstep with their narrative, they use force and the threat of force to shut you down,” he said. “Here, we were able to use the federal courts to turn that narrative on its head.”

The suit alleged violations of the First and Fifth Amendments as well as the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

‘Disproportionate harm’

Among the signs held by the protesters was one pointing out that while black women are 11 percent of the population, they are victims in 36 percent of abortions.

They contend Planned Parenthood and “abortion care” have “suppressed the black vote more effectively that poll taxes, literacy tests, voter ID requirements, and Ku Klux Klan lynchings combined.”

The signs point out that by 2014, 18 million African-American babies had been killed, calling it a “black genocide.”

The lawsuit asserted the museum hides from its visitors “the fact that abortion is disproportionately harming the African American community” and celebrates supporters of abortion.

They noted that the museum promotes the Black Lives Matter movement, which the protesters describe as “viciously pro-abortion.” And they pointed to the museum’s celebration of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, who was pro-abortion, while completely ignoring current Justice Clarence Thomas, who is pro-life.

136,160,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/finding-wonder-foreboding-pathway-total-eclipse/,"It is rather hard to write with eclipse glasses on this morning, but “I want to be ready,” as the old spiritual intones. Not ever known for culinary process, I even tried to turn Oreos into eclipse cookies. Massive fail!

Like many others, I have anticipated this day with a sense of foreboding and wonder. The foreboding is a lot less than the wonder, to be sure. The foreboding in my case has to do with religious quacks that claim a natural scientific event is an act of God’s judgment or an apocalyptic event signaling the end of time. That this portent, which happens quite regularly, by the way, has to haul this fake theological freight creates a stumbling block to coherent belief. It is a responsible perspective to hold a worldview that attends to the wisdom of both theology and science.

Another of these celestial alignments will happen in 2024, and I suspect many of the same arguments will be in vogue. It will be an election year, so beware! Some will proclaim that God is judging a “godless nation” by blotting out the sun, and who knows but this might be the very last chance we have to repent. Please understand, I am all for repentance — deep, daily and determined. God’s call always beckons us to turn around to traverse a more life-giving pathway, but I demur at the heated rhetoric of an interventionist theology that only sees God active in the cataclysmic.

God is at work in the regularity of seasons, circadian rhythms and evolutionary trajectories. The old language of calling a brutal storm or other inexplicable event an “act of God” is receding, thankfully.

I do recall when Yorkminster Cathedral was hit by lightning in 1980 and insurance adjustors and religious figures debated whether to call it a divine action. Some concluded that it was because of a liberal bishop; others were less convinced. It is hard to believe that this language persists.

Better to see the whole of creation within providential care, even if it is not a tightly controlled oversight. Terrible and beautiful things occur, often all mixed up together. God is not absent from any of them, and the presence of suffering provokes interrogation of a benevolent deity. Human participation in the unfinished, groaning creation sometimes wreaks more havoc; it is hard to calculate the extent of our influence for good or evil.

Wonder far outstrips foreboding, however. I am thrilled by the fervor with which people have planned ahead to secure the best viewing spots. I delight in the ways this astronomical occasion provides teachers with an expansive scientific lesson. I relish the new learning about animal and crop behavior during a solar eclipse, especially as this is a key concern for those of us who live in the plains. I chortle at the kids who tried out their glasses days in advance, just in case. I revel, also, in the capacity of humans to experience wonder. We were made for this, you know.

It was Rudolf Otto, a scholar of religion in the early 20th century, who wrote about the “idea of the holy,” contending that each one of us has an inherent response to the numinous realities of life. By numinous he meant a divine power at work that invites us to a sense of mystery, fear and, perhaps, worship. At the heart of the religious impulse is the sense of grandeur of God’s creation, the idea that something lies behind the phenomena of earthly processes. A pious Christian, Otto sought to defend belief from naturalistic tendencies, the argument that the whole of this world can be explained without a theistic hypothesis.

It is very instructive for human beings to experience themselves as both infinitesimal and significant, with an appropriate understanding of their place in the scale of our universe. This means we understand that we are latecomers, beneficiaries of a long history that preceded us. We are dependent on all the life forms that have gone before, as well as those that continue to companion humanity today. It also means that the glorious beauty that surrounds us points to a vast intelligence beyond our comprehension. Our recognition of both our frailty and magnificent vocation as God’s image bearers kindles wonder that God is mindful of us, as Psalm 8 states.

I hope our experience of this event illumines a spirit of contemplation as we marvel at God’s handiwork and the perdurance of an expanding universe. I also hope that we find ever more constructive ways to hold both science and faith in our heart. We must read both books — of Scripture and of nature. Holding them together makes for an informed sense of wonder.

137,161,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/god-works-work/,"As our nation celebrated Labor Day, giving attention to the role and dignity of workers, we should also consider the role of human agency in accomplishing divine labor. Theologians always interrogate such things! Surely the work of Christians is more than simply fueling the engine of capitalism; meaningful work also participates in God’s intention for the world. Yet, determining how God is at work in this world is one of the hardest theological challenges.

Think about the urgent crises confronting us. People of faith pray for deliverance, trusting God to hold back the waters of the sea or help them elude their enemies pushing them over the border in Myanmar or rid them of the malignancy growing in their bodies or quell the rising tide of white supremacy. Fervent prayer may not create the conditions for which they pray; however, many continue to trust that God’s providence will prevail. We must ask: through what instrumentality?

Reading narratives of deliverance in Scripture evokes hope for God’s mighty acts to be victorious once again. Many preachers and Sunday school teachers have followed the lectionary texts from Exodus in this extended season after Pentecost. We have noted the trickery of Shiphrah and Puah, the resistance of Pharaoh’s daughter and Miriam, and God’s call of Moses. We have pondered the extended saga of Israel in Egypt, questioning why deliverance was long delayed.

In these early chapters, the writer declares that God has “heard their groaning,” and “remembered God’s covenant,” “seen the misery of the people,” and has “come down to rescue them from the power of Egypt.” The suffering of the people touches the heart of God, although God leans the plans for deliverance upon humans who are themselves part of the oppressed. The means by which God has come down to rescue does not seem very sturdy, and how God will be involved is at question.

God’s commission to Moses is for him to go to Pharaoh and “bring my people out of Egypt.” God’s promise is very simple: “I will be with you,” and the proof that it is truly God who sends him is this: “When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall all worship God here on this mountain” (Exodus 3:12). What? It is only after the liberation is accomplished that Moses will know who propelled him into this high stakes mission? Oh my!

I often hear persons wonder out loud why God does not work in our day as God worked in biblical times. It appears that God does indeed work in the same way, inviting people to shared responsibility for God’s handiwork, which we inhabit and stain and heal. I believe that God is always calling humanity to do the needed holy work and that God is the power behind the actions of those courageous enough to trust God.

In a world where things can go terribly wrong — such as the human evocation of climate change that wreaks havoc — God is using every means to mend creation. The incarnation of Jesus teaches that God’s primary means of conducting redemptive work is through a partnership with humans who were tasked at the beginning to tend God’s handiwork. A long, grinding and luminous history of evolution antedates the human arrival, albeit a particular stewardship is required of those whom God has granted dominion.

Kathryn Tanner reminds us that God works in history at a different level than humans. For Tanner, divine and human agency are not in competition with one another. Because God is not in the same order of being as creatures, God’s power is universally extended and is at work in all things. Thus, there is no zero-sum game that suggests the more God is at work, the less humans can do — and vice versa.

Tanner, rather, points us to a renewed vision of how the incarnation determines how divine and human agency can be at work in the same person, who is a paradigm for how God chooses to accomplish the divine purpose. She calls us to think about God as “gift giver,” who not only imbues the Christ with holy presence to transform the horizon of human hopes, but makes possible human participation in Christ toward the same goal of redemption. Her theological vision that Christ is the key to what God is doing everywhere in the world guides our thinking about how human work and godly work always interface. Through God’s humility, we are always ingredient to saving work.

In times of challenge, trusting that God is at work empowering humans to work for the good of all is reassuring. It also prompts courageous action. While it is common to think that we are waiting on God, actually both God and others are waiting on us.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,God works; we work – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

Managed by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a group of scientists and academics, the clock was moved 30 seconds on Thursday. The clock’s hands had been at two-and-a-half minutes to midnight in 2017.

Rachel Bronson, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists CEO, said this year that nuclear weapons and the unpredictability of nations holding them were a major consideration.

“All of the major weapons states are investing in their nuclear arsenals,” said Robert Rosner, research professor in the Department of Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Chicago.

“North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests demonstrated an accelerating of building a new generation of weapons of mass destruction. In south Asia, the emphasis on missile capabilities grows.

“The nuclear arsenals of all of the major weapons states are being updated and imbued with enhanced capabilities. The Trump administration’s Nuclear Posture Review appears likely to increase the types and roles of nuclear weapons in US defense plans,” he added.





Sharon Squassoni, from George Washington University, said US-Russian relations were key element to the board’s decision.

“Both countries still possess about 95 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons and without bilateral progress there is little incentive for others to move forward. However, for the first time in many years no US-Russian nuclear arms control negotiations are underway,” Squassoni said.

“If the draft US Nuclear Posture Review is any guide to US policy, there will be no US-Russia nuclear arms control negotiations for the foreseeable future. Instead we could see a return to a nuclear arms race.”

Set for official release in February, a leaked draft of the US review on nuclear strategies indicated that it will push to develop more ‘low-yield’ nukes due to concerns over China, Iran, and Russia’s capabilities.

For decades the clock has been used as an ominous reminder of how close humanity is to destroying the world. Midnight represents total disaster or an apocalypse.

Originally decided on by Bulletin Editor Eugene Rabinowitch, the clock is now in its 71st year. It’s settings are now based on an academic board’s view on the advancement of nuclear arms, climate change and artificial intelligence.

The Doomsday Clock originally featured in a magazine back in the 1940s, when the development of nuclear arms first became a global fear. In its first outing the clock read seven minutes to midnight. The furthest away from midnight it has ever been came in 1991 after the end of the Cold War – when it struck 17 minutes to midnight.

Earlier this year, the Bulletin’s Nuclear Notebook warned of North Korea’s nuclear missile potential.

“Based on available information, we cautiously estimate that North Korea might have produced sufficient fissile material to build 30 to 60 nuclear weapons, and that it might possibly have assembled 10 to 20 warheads,” the report, co-written by Federation of American Scientists researcher Hans M Kristensen, stated.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Countdown to disaster: Doomsday Clock now 2 minutes to midnight,,,[''],"The Best in uncensored news, information, and analysis",,,

Uganda’s president: I love Trump because ‘he tells Africans frankly’



Apparently not everyone in Africa is as easily offended as the American media or whoever else believes a word Dick Durbin says. President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda isn’t even sure Donald Trump called African countries shitholes - and neither is anyone else who wasn’t in the meeting, since the renowned liar Durbin is the only on-the-record source saying he did - but Museveni doesn’t seem too concerned about it. In fact, he thinks it’s a sign of strength that you can deal with the president of the United States calling your country a shithole:

Uganda’s president says he loves President Donald Trump and that he should be praised for not mincing words. “I love Trump because he tells Africans frankly,” President Yoweri Museveni said Tuesday, shortly after the U.S. ambassador apologized for Trump’s recent reference to African nations as “s—-hole countries.” “I don’t know whether he was misquoted or whatever. But he talks to Africans frankly,” Museveni said. “In the world, you cannot survive if you are weak.” The Ugandan leader was addressing members of the regional East African Legislative Assembly. Several African nations have expressed shock and condemnation at Trump’s remark. He has denied using that language while others present says he did.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Uganda’s president: I love Trump because ‘he tells Africans frankly’,"Dan Calabrese, Because Without America, There Is No Free World.",,"['Conservative News', 'Conservative Newspaper']","News, Politics, Editorials, commentary, Canada Free Press, Because without America, there is no Free World",,,

Originally, the Supreme Court had allowed the Trump administration to reinstate part of the travel ban at the end of 2017; however, the federal appeals court in San Francisco found that Trump had overstepped his authority. According to Reuters:

‘The appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump had exceeded the authority Congress had given him over immigration and had violated a part of the immigration laws barring discrimination in the issuance of visas.’

In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco remarked:

‘The courts below have overridden the president’s judgments on sensitive matters of national security and foreign relations, and severely restricted the ability of this and future presidents to protect the nation.’

Those against the travel ban have continually argued that Trump’s ban is unconstitutional as it is directed unfairly toward countries that have a majority of Muslim citizens. They point to Trump’s own comments during his presidential campaign regarding Muslims.

‘The president has repeatedly explained that the two orders pursue the same aim.’

However, the Trump team have denied the allegations of discrimination.

‘The proclamation’s process and substance confirm that its purpose was to achieve national security and foreign-policy goals, not to impose anti-Muslim bias.’

Arguments are planned for April, and the court estimates a ruling will come by June. Additionally, the Supreme Court has a docket loaded with major issues including “voting rights, union power, digital privacy and a clash between claims of religious freedom and gay rights.”

145,171,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/5-signs-you-are-gaslighting-your-children/,"While most of us only want to do what is best for our children some of us have a warped view of what exactly that is. Sure, we all think our children are content but are they?

Gaslighting, for those who do not know, is a form of psychological abuse. It is a tactic many abusers use to make someone feel as if their reality is completely incorrect. This is a very manipulative tactic and it takes a big toll on the victim. While some of this happens in romantic relationships it is also often present in parent-child relationships as well.

Gaslighting is something that is done slowly and leaves the victim practically brainwashed. People who are gaslighting their children may not realize they are doing so because for some it could even be part of a cycle but it is something that needs to stop. If the following list of signs stand out to you in your relationship with your child you need to do better and really change your ways.

5 Signs You Are Gaslighting Your Children:

1. You mock your children.

Humiliating your children whether you realize you are doing so or not can be considered gaslighting. Mocking your children leaves them feeling confused and upset. This is not an acceptable thing to do. Just because you don’t think they should be upset over something doesn’t mean you should make them feel like what they are feeling is invalid.

Sure, as the parent you are the one in control, but you should not be overassertive. While we all are afraid of our children branching out and taking flight on their own we need to accept that it will happen. Don’t make your child feel like by being more independent he or she is doing anything wrong. You should not make your child feel helpless without you, one day you will not be around. You children need to know how to function without you.

3. You never apologize.

As parents, even we can be wrong from time to time. It is important to say sorry when we make mistakes. We should not be making out children feel like they are always doing things wrong even when they aren’t. While it may be hard to apologize to your children it is important to do so in some cases.

4. You are too hard on your child.

Sure, sometimes kids make mistakes, this is perfectly normal. Flying off the handle each and every time is not going to help the situation. Don’t make your child hide things from you if you are constantly overreacting they will stop sharing things with you. Sure, discipline is important but only to an extent. It is not the end of the world every time your son or daughter forgets to do a chore or something of the sort.

You tell your child he or she is overreacting when in all reality he or she is not. This is not a good way to parent. You should not tell your children what they should or shouldn’t be feeling. Their emotions are their own, you cannot change them. This goes hand in hand with the parents who try to tell their children what they do and do not like, it does not work like that.

146,172,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/how-hypnosis-could-cure-us-of-our-deepest-darkest-fears/,"Have you ever stopped to really consider the wide assortment of fears and phobias that exist in today’s society? From zombies to public speaking, clowns to heights – there appears to be a fear for nearly anything that you can think of.

Don’t believe me? There’s even a technical term for the fear of phobias. That’s right, phobophobia is defined as “the fear of phobia(s) and, more specifically, of the internal sensations associated with that phobia and anxiety.” These fears can range from a mere inconvenience to completely debilitating, impacting every area of your life and interfering with your ability to function normally.

Recently Chapman University initiated a nationwide survey, asking Americans just what strikes fear deep in their hearts. Participants were asked their level of fear relating to approximately 80 different possible fears ranging from the government to natural disasters. The researchers then compiled the data and came up with a list of the top fears in the United States which included some interesting and eye-opening answers, such as corrupt government officials, pollution of drinking water, high medical bills and air pollution.

While the answers of the Chapman University Survey on American Fears were bigger concerns, focusing largely on politics and worldwide pollution, many Americans share fears that hit much closer to home. It is estimated that 25 million Americans share a fear of flying, or ‘aerophobia,’ while ‘trypanophobia,’ or a fear of needles can have a significant impact on your ability to obtain necessary, life-saving health care. Acknowledging the potential impact that these fears can have on our life and well-being, experts have devoted time, energy and funding into better understanding the cause and treatment of various fears, phobias and anxiety.

One area that has researchers and experts incredibly hopeful is the use of hypnosis in treatment. In order to understand how hypnosis can work, you must first have a thorough understanding of the way that phobias occur mentally. At some point in our lives, often throughout childhood (although they can develop as an adult), something causes our mind to create an association between two unrelated things – the object of our fear, and the feelings associated with the fear reaction. In some cases, this association is created due to a traumatic event, for example, a dog bite as a child can lead to a lifelong fear of dogs. In other examples, however, the trigger may not be as easily identified. In fact, you may not even know why you are afraid of something, you just know that you are.

Hypnosis works by reprogramming the way that your mind reacts to that specific trigger. If dogs are currently associated with feelings of fear and anxiety, a hypnotherapist will work to relax the mind, desensitize the brain to that event or object, and reprogram the response. It’s important to note that the this isn’t a quick fix! The procedure, known as ‘systematic desensitization,’ is a gradual reprogramming, slowing giving you control over your response to the trigger and encouraging positive responses.

With hard work, dedication and the assistance of a good hypnotherapist, you can find freedom from your biggest fears!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"How Hypnosis Could Cure Us of Our Deepest, Darkest Fears",Gerald Sinclair,,[''],,"curing fear through hypnosis, hypnotist, systematic desensitization, curing fear, curing phobias, fear, phobias, conquering fear, hypnotherapy, phobia, hypnosis",,

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Israel. Palestine. Jews. Arabs.

Have you ever asked yourself why the situation in the Middle-East doesn’t seem to be getting any better these days? And what’s this conflict all about in the first place?

In case you’re totally new to world politics, the Middle-East crisis is one of the most politically and religiously charged conflicts on the whole planet! Virtually every country in the world has had a say on how these two cultures and peoples, very different from each other should share the land that they both want to claim as their home and native land.

We have the Israelis who wish to have a homeland for the Jews with Jerusalem as its capital.

We have the Palestinians who wish to have a homeland for their people and wish to claim some parts of Jerusalem (East) as its capital.

Both sides have committed atrocities and inhumane actions towards each other.

Both sides continually agree to disagree with each other when trying to negotiate peace talks.

Both sides claim ownership of the disputed territories for thousands of years.

Some call Israel an apartheid state.

Some say the Palestinians are being used as a means to drive the Jews into the Mediterranean Sea.

We can go back and forth arguing about this non-stop until someone drops a bomb on all of Israel and wipes everybody out!

But…we don’t have to go to extremes like that in order to understand the truth of the matter, and to once and for all put an end to the dispute on both sides, and move forward for the sake of humanity and the evolving human spirit.

Note: I personally know what it’s like to be involved in a bitter legal dispute where both sides wanted to prove their point was right. Yes, children were involved so the stakes were high and emotions were high, and it got very ugly towards the end. But now, that’s all water under the bridge! With time a solution was found! It came from a totally unexpected source, but nevertheless, it ended a bitter dispute that would never have ended, as both sides were at a legal stalemate.

So from that experience, I bring to you a different view and perspective of the Israel/Palestine Conflict, and how it be resolved very simply and fairly for both sides.

What is presented here is nothing but the truth. The reason why past solutions and resolutions failed was the truth was never presented so that all sides could see with clarity, enabling them to make an informed decision based on logic and facts, rather than heresay, pride and charged emotions that have caused too many people to suffer or die needlessly.

Why don’t we start from the beginning then. Since Christians, Jews and Muslims share the same genetic and cultural history, from the days of Abraham, we will use the Authroized King James Version of the Bible and/or the Jewish Tanakh as our sole reference. For anyone that questions the integrity of the KJV Bible or the Tanakh, we invite you to see two of many mathematical and historical proofs to show that the words penned in those scripts are an INTEGRATED MESSAGE that was written in a domain outside of our boundaries of space and time.

Jerusalem is a very old city.

We do not know how far back in time it dates, but we see it first being mentioned here:

Joshua 10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;

At first glance, this verse may not sound like a big deal, but when we look a little closer we can clearly see that;

Jerusalem was originally inhabited by peoples and had a king named Adonizedek

Joshua was on a mission to conquer territories that were neighbouring to Jerusalem

The children of Israel struck fear into the leaders and kings of cities that had yet to encounter Joshua and his tribe

If we dig a little deeper, we see that just a few verses away, we see why the then king of Jerusalem was afraid:

Joshua 10:3 Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

Joshua 10:4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

Joshua 10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

King Adonizedek was so terrified of the approaching children of Israel that he ran to neighbouring cities to ask them for help in defending themselves against the impending attack. We see that the 5 cities listed were predominantly of Amorite nationality.

A quick search on Amorite in the Bible brings up some interesting verses, but one in particular, stands out for the purpose of this lesson:

Amos 2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

For good measure, we’ll also focus on the king of Hebron and his origins, since he was mentioned as being in allegiance with the king of Jerusalem to overthrow the children of Israel.

Joshua 15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

What we see from these two verses is that:

The Amorites were giants.

Hebron is an Amorite city where Arba the father of Anak once dwelled.

Before we go further about who Arba and Anak were, let’s take a look at another important city that has been mentioned quite often in the news lately.

Gaza is a very old city.

We do not know how far back in time it dates, but we see it first being mentioned here:

Genesis 10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

Joshua 11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

What we learn from these two verses is that:

Gaza was inhabited by peoples called Canaanites before the children of Israel showed up on the scene.

Gaza was inhabited by people called Anakims.

Going back to Joshua 15:13, we can see that the Anakim peoples were descended from someone called Anak, and inhabited the areas along the coast and around Jerusalem BEFORE the children of Israel, later to be the Jews invaded those territories.

Now with these facts, it might seem as though the Palestinian people today inhabited the land of Israel before the Jews did, and therefore have a right to call those lands their home.

But, let us dig a bit deeper shall we.

Who exactly are the Anakim people? Well, let’s see what the Bible has to say!

Numbers 13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

Okay. Now we’re onto something. Giants had inhabited the lands where the children of Israel, led by God invaded the Canaanite territories and eventually settled in and around Jerusalem. Generations later, a kingdom and temple would be established and destroyed, but only for a brief moment in time.

Going back to the giants, these weren’t just your average tall person that we commonly see in society today, usually as athletes like basketball players that are anywhere between 7 and 10 feet. These giants were much bigger, and meaner and can first be traced back to here:

Genesis 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

Genesis 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

Genesis 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

Genesis 6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

Genesis 6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.

What we learn from this is that sometime in the past the was an alien invasion, whereby the sons of God (fallen angels that followed Lucifer’s rebellion in the pre-Adamite days) introduced themselves to humanity, interbred with them whereby their offspring were mutants, half-human/half-Annunaki. Not only was interbreeding done between humans and the nephilim, but because they had advanced technology, they introduced genetic manipulation into the the flora and fauna on the earth; mixing DNA with just about every living carbon-based organism. This was done to corrupt humanity, and for Lucifer and his legion of followers to wipe humanity off the face of the earth and to reclaim it as their own again!

Yes, that’s right! Aliens are real. They are specifically mentioned in the Bible, as being in league with the Adversary, Satan, the Devil, Lucifer, for he is an alien too!

So now we get a clearer picture of why Joshua and the children of Israel were given divine powers and authority to rid the Levant of the giant population!

These giants trace their roots back to Noah’s flood, but somehow some of them survived and managed to slowly repopulate the earth. Their next attempt to thwart God’s plan for humanity was to construct a tower in Babel, Iraq where Nimrod became a ruthless (might hunter) warrior and dictator. All world religions and their customs can be traced back to Nimrod. Sikhism, Taosim, Buddhism and all other eastern religions, Islamic traditions, Catholic traditions, Greek traditions and so many more got their origins not long after the flood when the surviving Nephilim/Annunaki reinfested the generations that followed after Noah with everything we know today about witchcraft, sorcery, prostitution, worshiping inanimate objects, rituals, astrology, necromancy, capitalism, socialism, child/blood sacrifices and a host of other idolatrous practices that serve humanity no purpose except to deter it from evolving into what it was created to be…

After reading this it should be very clear what God’s intentions were when he told the children of Israel to slay every man, woman, child and animal that they encountered in those cities.

Joshua 6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.

Joshua 6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

It was a city that contained an unstable population of human/nephilim half-breed that are the cause of all corruption on earth, and had to be eliminated at all costs. Call it the first alien virus that could wipe out humanity….slowly and surely! Human babies might be cute, but hybrid human/demonic beings are something else altogether. There are many things that mainstream churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and schools will not teach you, and for good reason! Our entire society has been influenced by the Annunaki/Nephilim and this is the reason for all the oppression, wars, inequality, strife and all other human woes that we can never seem to totally get rid of.

In order to truly make the change that humanity needs to go in, we need to stop hiding from the truth, come to terms with it and make the necessary changes in ourselves and our attitudes first, before pointing fingers at anyone. Anyone pointing and wagging fingers without first examining all the evidence and coming to terms with it is just a hypocrite and should be avoided or shown the ways of their error. We NEED to consider the Alien Option when dealing with what’s going on in the Middle East, for this will impact the rest of the world, whether it is ready or not. The Americans have disclosed their proofs of encounters with aliens, their technology and culture, so it should be the same for Israel and Palestine to call things out as they really are, and to stop using the world stage to do a song and dance that did not originate with them in the lands they wish to claim as their own, but originated a long time ago by a prideful angelic being named Lucifer that thought he knew God’s plan better than God himself!

Don’t let that be your mistake! For you will join Lucifer and all those who supported him directly and indirectly as they rejected the message of the BIble and its plan for humanity.

Be glad and thankful that YOU WERE CREATED for a ROYAL purpose! You are replacement staff for the fallen angels that vacated their homes on the planet Heaven!

Revelation 2:25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

Revelation 2:27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

Revelation 2:28 And I will give him the morning star.

That’s right! The Elohim (God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit) have an evolutionary plan for humanity. We are to be transformed bodily in be capable of assuming our new roles as Royal heirs to the coming Kingdom which will be headquartered in Jerusalem in the not too distant future.

I hope this provides a more insightful look into the Israel/Palestine conflict and why it will take a supernatural event in order to clear the air and change the rules of how the game will be played.

How will things change? Well, Jesus said it himself what to watch for…

Matthew 24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

Matthew 24:33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.

Matthew 24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.

Matthew 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

Matthew 24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

Matthew 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,

Matthew 24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Fake News—This term has become quite the buzz word over the past year or so, almost to the point where you can’t read the comment section of any news article without seeing it shouted at least once or twice. But, ‘fake news’ isn’t…new. I once read, many years ago, that newspapers would often publish completely fictitious news, under the guise of REAL news, to help drum up readership. I’m sure that most readers at the time had a pretty good understanding of what was real and what wasn’t, just as contemporary readers can usually discern between actual news and the sensational stuff found in grocery store tabloids. They knew the difference between entertainment and what was actually going on in their community. However, as modern readers go back and look at these vintage archives, it can be a tad confusing. WAS this actual news? Did the people of the time BELIEVE it to be real? Just what the heck was going on?!?

I love looking through old newspaper archives, and many times, I find some really strange little gems! And while newspaper articles featuring fantastical stories can be found year round, even in our local publications, I recently noticed that quite a few were published in the month of January. January of 1914 was an especially weird month for some reason.

1. The Mountain Octopus : The story of the Mountain Octopus appeared in local papers on January 11, 1946. A group of students in Thomas, WV, discovered several of the creatures in a local stream, and brought two back to school with them to show to staff/students. No one was ever quite sure how and why an ocean creature got (and survived) in our cold, freshwater streams of West Virginia. 2. Hungarian Woman Sought Murder Clue from Spirits : This strange story appeared in a Huntington, WV newspaper on January 23, 1914. A widow from Thurmond, WV made a stop in Huntington after traveling to Ohio to seek the services of a well-known medium. The woman was seeking information from the spirits concerning her husband’s recent murder. 3. Meteor, or Bad Omen Over Huntington? : Here’s another weird story from Huntington, WV that appeared in the local paper on January 13, 1914. Around that time, a meteor was seen streaking over the skies of Huntington. However, a group of kids playing near the old C&O Hospital claimed that they saw the meteor then spell out a name in fire, and then morph into the image of a woman’s face in the sky! 4. Women in Hysterics as Ghost Runs Down Street : Although the account was published in a local paper on January 8, 1914, this tale actually comes from New York and is a humorous telling of how a prisoner on the loose with a sheet flung over his head terrorized some church ladies leaving a service. I won’t come out and say that any of these news stories are actually ‘fake news,’ but I will venture to assume that January has, historically, been a slow month for reporters here in the tri-state!

The negative effects of Fluoride have been well documented and brought to the public eye.

As it turns out Fluoride is commonly found in most water products, this is causing tons of health issues in millions of people. While some may argue that Fluoride is healthy for us or at least for our teeth, it actually is not. Fluoride negatively affects the human nervous system and actually is not good for our teeth at all.

Exposure to Flouride is even more common than we would like to think, it is unavoidable in this day and age. Fluoride can cause fluorosis which is a condition of overall complete tooth decay and malformation. It can have a negative effect on children’s IQ, cause brain disorders, cause body toxicity, and many other things. It seems to fit in right along with lead and mercury, to be honest.

It’s seen several of those brought in leave. However, they’ve also seen seasoned, experienced, long-time experts leave after becoming frustrated with the way Trump treats everything.

Another long-time expert within the State Department is leaving. Foreign Policy reported:

‘In the latest departure, the State Department’s most experienced U.N.-based sanctions expert stepped down Friday, sending more than a decade of expertise out the door and contributing to a bout of brain drain that is diminishing the role of American diplomats in shaping Washington’s sanctions policy …’

That tome of knowledge and expertise would be Joshua Black. Black was the chief sanctions and counterterrorism expert at the United Nations, and America is losing him thanks to his frustration with the Trump administration.

According to sources, part of Black’s frustration had to do with the Iran nuclear deal that Trump has opposed vehemently. Furthermore, the Trump administration has overstepped the State Dept. several times.

‘Black’s resignation coincides with a shift in the way Washington approaches sanctions, current and former officials say. The White House has been bypassing the State Department’s seasoned veterans while tasking the U.S. military and intelligence establishment to step up their role in uncovering violations, particularly in Iran and North Korea, those officials say.’

One official told Foreign Policy that Black and his team were “essential to the department for coordinating sanctions in the [United Nations.]

And we’re losing him thanks to Trump. Trump wants to make America a safer nation except he continues to cause the experts to leave.

January 25, 2018

In the U.S. Senate Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to break a partisan 49-49 tie on President Trump's nomination of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback for the post of ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom.

Every Democrat, joined by independent Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, voted against Brownback's nomination, while the Republicans lost their narrow advantage due to the absence of two senators.

The GOP controls 51 of the Senate's 100 seats, but Sen. John McCain of Arizona is undergoing cancer treatment and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is in Davos for the World Economic Forum.

So in his role as president of the Senate, Pence cast the tie-breaking vote first during a procedural vote to end debate on Brownback's nomination, and then again in the final roll call vote, which passed 50-49.

It was the second time Pence has broken a tied nomination vote. On February 7 last year he did so to advance Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary by a 51-50 vote. On that occasion Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Me.) voted with the Democrats against Trump's nominee.

After the vote, Brownback tweeted his thanks to Trump, Pence, ""and all the Senators who supported my nomination. I'm looking forward to starting my new position as Ambassador and working hard for the American people and religious freedom around the world.""

In a tweet of his own, Pence said he was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote, describing Brownback as ""a principled man of faith who will help the Trump Admin advance support for persecuted religious groups around the world.""

Trump first nominated Brownback as ambassador-at-large last July. The last person to hold the post, Rabbi David Saperstein, stepped down when President Obama left office last January.

Wednesday's vote was a close shave for Brownback, who himself served in the Senate for 14 years until seven years ago. The Kansas governor has upset many Democrats with social conservative policies on abortion and LGBT issues, including a 2015 executive order that rescinded protections for LGBT state workers.

Leading the charge against him on the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said the person who holds the ambassadorship must be committed to defending the religious freedom of all religious minorities around the world.

""Unfortunately, Gov. Brownback's career has been defined by a lack of tolerance for those who do not share his own beliefs,"" he said. ""I fear he will only focus solely on protecting Christian minorities, while we must acknowledge publicly that people of all faiths are persecuted and demand equal representation.""

Menendez went on to cite other Brownback policy positions, including on LGBT issues, and said that during Brownback's term in the Senate he had ""often used religion to push policies that undermine the right of women to access healthcare, to control their own bodies and determine their own destinies.""

Daniel Darling, vice president for communications at the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) of the Southern Baptist Convention said on his Twitter feed it was ""sad the nomination of Governor Brownback is being politicized for this important position.""

Darling noted that the ERLC had ""worked well"" with the last person to hold the post, despite not seeing eye-to-eye on many issues at home.

""We disagreed with Rabbi Saperstein on many domestic issues but worked well with him on international religious freedom,"" he said. ""This is a bipartisan issue.""

Saperstein, who was the director of the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism, was President Obama's second nominee to the international religious freedom post, serving from Jan. 2015-Jan. 2017. Before that, Baptist pastor Suzan Johnson Cook held the position from Apr. 2011-Oct. 2013.

The top religious freedom post was vacant for almost half of Obama's eight years in office (43 months out of 96), and religious freedom campaigners were troubled by how long it took him - 513 days after his inauguration - to first announce a nomination.

Trump nominated Brownback 186 days after taking office.

CAIR complaint

In his remarks opposing the confirmation Wednesday, Menendez did not elaborate on his stated concern that Brownback would ""focus solely on protecting Christian minorities.""

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations has complained about Brownback actions such as his signing into law of a bill in 2012 designed to block any use of Islamic law (shari'a) in state courts or government agencies.

""Only under the Trump administration would someone so opposed to the constitutional rights of an American faith community be appointed to safeguarding international religious freedom,"" CAIR government affairs director Robert McCaw said when Brownback was nominated.

As a senator, Brownback in 2005 called on then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resign unless the world body acted decisively to stop the carnage in Sudan's Darfur region, where the victims (as well as the perpetrators) were Muslims.

His Senate career also saw Brownback advocate strongly for religious freedom and rights protection in non-Islamic countries, including China, Vietnam and North Korea. Victims of persecution in those countries include Christians, but also independent Buddhists, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims and Falun Gong adherents.

Brownback was a key sponsor of the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act which established both the ambassador-at-large post and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent statutory body.

USCIRF chairman Daniel Mark on Wednesday welcomed the confirmation, saying the commission was looking forward to working with Brownback ""in advancing the U.S. government's promotion of international religious freedom.""

Even after a meeting between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Donald Trump at the White House, they were unable to come to any promising ground.

And now, the finger-pointing has begun, and Trump is pointing a big, sausagy orange stub at Democrats. Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to lay all the blame on congressional Democrats.

He tweeted:

‘Democrats are holding our Military over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!’

Hold up a minute. During the momentous roundtable that was caught on camera, Trump displayed a shocking moment where many thought he’d actually work with Democrats to reach a deal. Granted, Republicans almost had a conniption fit when Trump said he’d sign anything put in front of him.

After saying that, he was presented with a bipartisan deal, and he refused to sign it.

Additionally, Trump can point that little orange nub at Democrats all he wants, but at one point he did say he thought a government shutdown would be good for the country.

Back in 2013, he tweeted:

‘[email protected] leadership should not be afraid of a government shutdown. They should be afraid of not defunding ObamaCare.’

He also tweeted:

‘83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. Room for cuts.’

Then there was this tweet:

‘Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day.’

Then in 2017 as the president of the United States he tweeted:

‘either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good “shutdown” in September to fix mess!’

Here’s the real kicker, though. Schumer offered Trump his precious wall. He offered to put the border wall “on the table,” and Trump still said no.

Also, it should be noted four Senate Republicans voted no on the measure Friday night.

Twitter users went nuts over Trump’s most recent tweet. You can check out their responses below.

January 25, 2018

A disputed derogatory remark about the poor state of African countries attributed to President Trump during a recent private Oval Office meeting between him and some members of the White House staff and Congress sparked a global political, diplomatic and media firestorm. Regardless of what may or may not have been said, the incident serves as a catalyst for inquisitive minds to put some much-needed sunlight on that continent's many problems.

The African Union - which represents 54 African member nations - immediately demanded the president retract his comment and apologize not only to Africans but to all people of African descent around the globe - even though he disputed what was reportedly said along with several others in the meeting.

It should not go unnoticed that the Union's founder is Libya's late dictator, Moammar Gadhafi - and the organization has colossally failed in its goal to seek ""an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena.""

In reality, centuries of torment didn't end for most African people after they forced European colonialists to relinquish power in the mid-20th century. Venal African leaders quickly filled the vacuum and have done little to develop their societies or emancipate Africans from their horrid existence despite vast continental riches. Worse yet, many of these leaders have enriched themselves at the expense of their countries by confiscating large amounts of wealth generated by private enterprises and foreign aid.

Freedom House (a global freedom watchdog) addressed Africa's problems in an earlier report, laying the blame on kleptocracies, military dictatorships and single-party personalistic regimes dominating political systems and perpetuating the cycle of violence and debilitating poverty. Its 2018 Report on Global Freedom discloses that only 10 percent (126.3 million) of Africa's 1.2 billion residents live in freedom with the same political rights and civil liberties accorded to Free World citizens.

Some startling facts emerge when one compares the conditions of Africa's 1.2 billion residents to the 6.2 billion who populate other parts of the world. According to data contained in CIA World Factbook, the average life span of Africans is 57 years, versus 71 years elsewhere. Africa's GDP is $4,938 per capita (distributed disproportionately between the well-to-do and the downtrodden), compared to the rest of the planet's $18,437. And Africa's illiteracy rate is 37 percent, more than four times greater than the illiteracy rate of 9 percent for the world's other residents.

The relative short life span of Africans is attributable to civil wars, genocide and anarchy that have plagued the continent for decades. Angola, Congo, Libya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, and Sudan exemplify the madness that has killed, displaced and terrorized tens of millions. Disease is also a main factor, with the CIA World Factbook reporting some 945 million people in 36 African countries having a very high risk to major infectious diseases.

The U.S. State Department's 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report provides more grim news for those who think slavery is a thing of the past. The report reveals that modern slavery (compelled labor and/or sex trafficking) is present in all 54 African countries, with 15 of them doing very little about it. In addition, Libya and Somalia are among the world's worst practitioners of modern day slavery. Many of those captured in slavery's web are migrants looking for better lives away from their birth country.

The U.S. State Department's Annual Terrorism Report for 2016 shows how the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism has also gripped the African continent, with 15 such terror groups operating there. They include the notorious groups al Qaeda; al-Shabab; Ansar al-Shariah; Boko Haram; and the Islamic State. These groups gestate and gain sympathy in most areas where Islam flourishes.

Notably, Islam's growing population now accounts for about 43 percent (523 million adherents) of Africa's population since the first Muslims arrived in the continent during the 7th century.

The U.S. has made substantial efforts to assist the African people in coping with these problems since independence. It has diplomatic representation in nearly every country, contributes the greatest amount of its economic and development aid to that region and has about 6,000 troops posted there to enhance security.

In recent years the U.S. has reportedly doubled the number of African immigrants entering the United States. In addition, one estimate pegs Western nation investments at over $1 trillion for African development since its independence.

The African Union, United Nations and others act as though Mr. Trump's alleged obscene description of African countries is worse than the vicious cycle of oppression, war, terrorism, genocide, poverty, illiteracy, slavery and disease that has plagued the continent for far too many years.

The tens of millions of African lives that have been lost, displaced or ruined because African leaders haven't put the welfare of their people first, and that many of the organizations and programs created to benefit the long-suffering African people have failed are clearly worse than a simple word.

Mr. Trump's critics should be mindful that long-standing African problems pre-date his presidency. Moreover, they should appreciate his most sacred obligation to the American people is keeping them safe and asking honest and hard questions about the potential security and health risks posed to Americans by immigrants (legal/illegal) entering the United States from dangerous parts of the world, including Africa.

Hopefully the day will come when the African people are able to live in freedom, peace, harmony, good health and realize the continent's enormous potential. And when that day comes perhaps Africans may decide to thank Mr. Trump for bringing much-needed attention to their current plight.

158,185,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/god-play-favorites/,"We hear quite a bit about survivors’ guilt these days. A neighbor’s house has a tree through the roof, while yours was spared. A soldier walks behind another; the one in the lead steps on a landmine, and the follower does not suffer loss of limbs. The hurricane skirts your hometown, and the adjoining county is hard hit. The rains come in due season to your land; not too far away drought is ravaging crops. Because you were born a Buddhist in Myanmar, you do not suffer the degradation of the Rohingya people.

Survivors may be grateful for the good fortune they experienced, but they are wise to consider at what cost to others. It is hard not to construct a “spared for a reason” narrative; however, it diminishes a sense of divine providence for those not spared. Even more horrific is the disregard for the value of lives of a different ethnicity. Survivors’ guilt is to be preferred over callous indifference, yet the sense of being specially “blessed” by God may lead to presumption.

On Sunday, the lesson from the Hebrew Bible was the story of Israel crossing the Red Sea with the army of Egypt in hot pursuit. Written obviously from the perspective of the liberated, the story is grisly in detailing how the Lord fought against Egypt on behalf of Israel. God instructs Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot drivers” (Exodus 14:26). Moses follows this directive, and the entire army is drowned. Not one of them remained.

The rabbis have long struggled with this text. God’s preservation of the people of covenant seems to have blood cost. Their further travel through the wilderness brings them to the land of promise, which is already occupied, a major inconvenience for both Canaanites and Israelites. More violence will ensue.

Codifying this narrative of election in Scripture then extended to Christians, many of whom became supersessionist, i.e., arguing that now their election in Christ eclipsed the Jews. Even when the humbler Christian approach acknowledged that they have been grafted into God’s enduring covenant with Israel, this claim still argues for a preferential treatment that elevates this Judeo-Christian trajectory over against all the rest of the world’s people.

Doctrines of election are a delicate matter, and it is hard to understand God’s love of the whole world through the lens of particularity that the Exodus story reveals. Does divine favoritism not make it hard for outsiders to find their place in the story of liberation? Christians have always argued that the purpose of the Abrahamic tradition of covenant was to bless the nations, as well as the historic people of God.

Some rabbis have suggested that the covenant with Israel was an experiment in divine-human intimacy. Would a people trust the Holy One enough to follow instruction and live in faithful patterns of worship and justice? Could Israel’s experience of Exodus become paradigmatic of God’s salvific purpose for all?

As we struggled with this text in my Sunday school class, an older man posed this question: “So who are God’s people?” I responded, “Everyone.” The follow-up question in my mind was, “When life is so hard, how do they know God is for them, that they are God’s own?”

This is where survivors come in, it seems to me. Those who are spared must not simply rejoice in their seeming “chosenness,” but must use every resource to alleviate the suffering of others. Guilt may not be the best source of motivation, but if it spurs compassion, it is constructive.

Christians believe that we come to know God’s favor through Christ and that he is the key to what God is doing throughout the world. What if the means through which God favors the suffering comes through those who already know of the expanse of God’s election in him? As Kathryn Tanner writes, through Christ “God gives the world God’s very own life” and saves us by establishing “the closest possible relationship with us.” The divine favor resting upon Jesus is a gift for the whole world.

Just as blaming God for every cataclysmic event founders, so does expecting God to provide miraculously all the means of recovery. God always uses humanity in the redemptive project, and the only privilege Christians have is their responsibility for acting in the name of the one they have come to know in Jesus Christ.

This approach does not require triumphalistic swagger or a certitude that quashes other perceptions of truth. Rather, it requires the humility of those called to participate with God in bringing this world to its true end. There is so much healing work to be done, and it is urgent.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Does God play favorites? – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

159,187,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/putting-god-test/,"The study of the Hebrew language did not come easily to me. Perhaps it was because I waited until my final year of seminary to take it; perhaps it was because it met at 3 p.m.; perhaps it was because I sat near a window; perhaps it was because our professor was so bored teaching at this elementary level — I am sure I can come up with some other excuses. I did pass, even making an A, but only because I memorized the Book of Jonah, a particular interest of our instructor.

As I have been teaching my way through Exodus with my Sunday school class, I certainly wish I had loved the Hebrew language more. I am sure that particular nuances elude me, yet translations do capture the richness of the narratives. Specifically, I want to know more about the issue of “testing.”

Exodus itself is a patchwork of stories, which were gathered and edited over many years. These stories are complex reflections on how God’s purpose will be accomplished with flawed human actors, and how human choices will impact the character of the divine. Wandering, while being led? It is very hard to map how the wilderness journey transpired, and clearly the people made the trek more difficult through obstinacy and lack of faith.

The wilderness was a dangerous place, and the way God through Moses led was open to suspicion. A frequent refrain of the congregation of Israel was, “Have you brought us out here to kill us?” Moses usually deflected and suggested that their complaint was against God, not him (Exodus 17:2). Because he claimed to be sent by God to shepherd this people, he had to take the heat. He was a convenient target — like our pastors.

God tested the people, and the people tested God. Neither seemed pleased about this abrasion in their relationship, yet it was an unavoidable reality as a covenant was being forged in a context of peril. Could God trust the people to follow the appointed leadership of Moses? Could the people trust that they were accompanied by God’s own presence? Their insistent question was, “Is the Lord among us or not?” We can only imagine the ways in which that same query is being voiced in the daily heart-rending devastations.

They found themselves at Rephidim without water, and once again God provided through an unexpected means. God instructed Moses to take his staff, the one he had used to turn the Nile into blood, was now to provide life-giving water. God’s own presence was in front of him at Horeb, and through Moses’ action of striking the rock, abundant water flowed. The place where this occurs portrays testing and quarreling, Massah and Meribah, and becomes a cautionary note about how not to behave toward God. Israel’s remarkable lack of faith was on display in full force.

It seemed that Moses believed that God had the right to test the people, but they should have refrained from testing God. After all, God has prerogatives that do not belong to human beings. Brueggemann says that this text warns against a utilitarian view of God, in which the divine “is judged by the desired outcomes for the asking community.” In other words, human measures should not presume to assess the adequacy of God. Dictating how God must respond reduces the sovereign one to our level, a risky proposition, indeed. While immanent among us, God is also working in ways that transcend our comprehension.

Jesus’ own experience in the wilderness raises this theological question once again. When the devil tempted him to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the temple in order to prove his identity in a spectacular way, Jesus quoted, “Do not put the Lord your God to the test” (Deuteronomy 6:16). The rest of the verse is “as you did at Massah.”

This faith venture is not easy, and we are beckoned to trust what we cannot see. Walking by faith and not sight produces a bit of anxiety, even for the mature in Christ. We echo the treasured words of Thomas Merton in Thoughts in Solitude:

“My Lord, God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end.”

Thankfully, the one who was seen and touched by earliest believers, the very sacrament of God’s presence with humanity, walks just ahead of us, marking out the pathway. It is this reality that leads Merton to conclude his prayer with these words:

“Therefore I will trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Putting God to the test – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

160,188,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/metoo-culture-sexual-predation/,"Social media is blowing up about a culture of sexual harassment and assault. The sordid tale of Harvey Weinstein’s pattern of predatory behavior against women has opened up a larger conversation about the almost universal experience of sexual exploitation of women. We have been ogled, called “babes,” touched without permission and raped. This does not just occur in the entertainment industry, but in every profession, including ministry.

Many clergywomen have voiced their experiences of violation, often perpetrated by friends in seminary, senior pastors and judicatory leaders — many of whom were publicly affirming of women in ministry. Baptists are not absent from this tale of abuse, and our refusal to talk about it forthrightly has only given license to predators. I am grateful that Baptist Women in Ministry is working on a major project addressing sexual abuse.

Far too many of us have a story of unwanted attention and worse, usually entailing a major power differential. Male colleagues have propositioned their female colleagues; some male pastors have taken advantage of vulnerable counselees; men have felt free to comment on women’s appearance in a sexually suggestive way; male professors have sought hugs and endearments from female graduate students or younger women colleagues; and, women have been silenced when speaking about these behaviors. Not surprising, the cycle has gone on. That is why so many Baptist women in ministry are posting “Me, too.”

There have been some serial predators in moderate Baptist circles, and only in conversation with other women in ministry have we discovered our similar stories of untoward actions by these men. They did not lose their ministerial credentials, and often they moved on to even more lucrative professional pursuits.

Experiences such as these bring shame to women, vocational redirection for some, and deepened awareness of how systems protect abusers. When a female pastor lodged a complaint about a pastoral colleague on the same staff (multiple women of the church had complained of his behavior toward them), many of the congregation took his side and departed when he left. They believed him incapable of such, and they did not trust the word of the female pastor. Why would she even need to bring it up, they wondered.

Patriarchy had certainly conditioned them to believe the male pastor instead of the female, even though she had higher rank on the pastoral staff. Congregants were more upset with her for calling for the discipline of this minister than upset with him for his violation of ministry ethics.

I have my own stories, as will many readers of this column. As a seminary student, a married doctoral student who was my Greek instructor began to stop by my study carrel in the library, inviting me to go out with him. He would say things like, “If only I had met you before I married,” and other inappropriate things. I refused his invitations, and I am not sure if my grade was lowered from an A to an A- because of that.

I was once invited for a weekend of preaching, and the pastor came to pick me up at the airport alone. I had thought his wife was coming, too. He kept asking if I wanted to go shopping or stop and get a drink. I managed to persuade him that I really needed to finish preparation for the varied events of the weekend. I kept my distance the rest of the weekend, making sure I was not alone with him. I later learned of other women who had experienced this kind of behavior — and more — from him.

As more women enter the ranks of ministry, some men have reacted to what they see as a threatening incursion with renewed diminishment of women, often through sexualizing them inappropriately. Women must call this out for what it is: predatory behavior. In a time when the president of the United States can brag about sexual assault, many men are emboldened to act on their worst impulses.

I am thankful that many are speaking clearly about a culture of sexual predation. This conversation is hardly finished, and many are finding their voices.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,#MeToo!

161,189,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/gods-invitation-life/,"Many preachers took up the Isaiah 55 passage this past Sunday, proclaiming the abundant provision of God for all that sustains life.

All you who are thirsty, come to the water!

You who have no money, come buy food, and eat!

Come, buy wine and milk, without money, without price!

The invitation is almost too good to be true! Who gets to purchase the finest food and drink without ever pulling out the credit card? Not only does the prophet speak of the basic physical nourishment we require, but also speaks of listening to God “that your soul may live” (55:3b). Many live unaware that our deepest longings go beyond what we eat and drink; hunger and thirst for the Holy One are inscribed into every human being. The problem is that we forget, over and over.

This portion of Isaiah announces that the time of desolation is over and that God may be sought — and found (v.6). God promises abundance, and renewal will come to a place covered with briers and thorns. Myrtle and cypress trees will flourish, and they will signal God’s goodness and restorative power. The landscape will mirror the renewing work God will do with the covenant people. As Irenaeus wrote, “The glory of God is humanity fully alive.”

Weariness with life stalks many in our time, and rather than turning to the source of renewal, we often simply numb ourselves with “food that does not satisfy” or distracting entertainment. Recently we have been shocked by the social media fueled suicide of an adolescent boy, goaded by the promptings of an adolescent girl. Teenage suicide is on the rise (and it is not just boys), and one cannot help but wonder at the level of emptiness so many experience. The incessant postings of peers who seem, by comparison, to have more friends, fun and family leaves others with a sense of diminishment that cannot be surmounted.

God’s invitation is nothing less than a beckoning to receive what God alone can provide: grace. Grace receives us as we are and renews the human spirit. Grace reminds us of who we are created to be and supplies the enervating work of the Spirit that we might fully live. Without grace, despair eclipses hope, and persons wonder if they can endure.

I have just enjoyed the extravagance of two weeks away in the mountains of northern New Mexico. The Idlewild Community, near Eagle Nest, provides a “preacher cabin” for visiting ministers. If you preach at the worship service, you have the privilege of staying in this rustic setting for the better part of a week. Since I preached two Sundays, I got to stay a bit longer. I am grateful that my school encouraged this investment of time, and I trust my soul will live with a greater sense of abundance.

The first word of the Rule of St. Benedict is “listen,” and this is what I have attempted to do in this time. I have listened to rushing streams flowing over creek stones; I have listened to wind ruffling wild flowers; I have listened to mule deer stirring in the brush; I have listened to rain on a tin roof; I have listened to bats squeaking under the eaves; I have listened to Scripture; and, I have listened to the sound of a “fine silence,” as Elijah testified. God has spoken through these media, and it has been good.

Most important has been an attentiveness to grace that is an intrinsic part of Sabbath. Wendell Berry says this of Sabbath: “… the field is tilled and left to grace.” Recognizing the limitation of effort and the need for rest requires a level of relinquishment, which most of us resist. Meister Eckhart used the concept of Seinlassen in his mystical writings; it is an attitude of “letting be,” of being in a state of receptivity to what might be born through us. He encourages humans to become the silent place of God’s presence.

Tethered to our devices, we presume that if we go off the grid dire things may happen. I had little wi-fi connectivity in the “preacher’s cabin,” and wonder of wonders, my school, church and family all survived just fine in my absence. Humility trusts that God’s grace will produce harvest even when our labor is suspended. The word “Shabbat” comes from the root Shin-Bet-Tav, meaning to cease. The Sabbath keeps the people more than people keep the Sabbath, as the Jewish adage reminds us.

Soon the rhythms of summer will be behind us, and the regularity of academic and ecclesial schedules will order our days and weeks. The memory of this time of renewal will linger, I trust, and remind me to return to the source of life, where one may drink deeply. God’s invitation is ever present, and abundant grace is offered.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,God’s invitation to life – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

January 24, 2018

New FBI texts highlight a motive to conceal the president's involvement.

From the first, these columns have argued that the whitewash of the Hillary Clinton-emails caper was President Barack Obama's call - not the FBI's, and not the Justice Department's. (See, e.g., here, here, and here.) The decision was inevitable. Obama, using a pseudonymous email account, had repeatedly communicated with Secretary Clinton over her private, non-secure email account.

These emails must have involved some classified information, given the nature of consultations between presidents and secretaries of state, the broad outlines of Obama's own executive order defining classified intelligence (see EO 13526, section 1.4), and the fact that the Obama administration adamantly refused to disclose the Clinton-Obama emails. If classified information was mishandled, it was necessarily mishandled on both ends of these email exchanges.

If Clinton had been charged, Obama's culpable involvement would have been patent. In any prosecution of Clinton, the Clinton-Obama emails would have been in the spotlight. For the prosecution, they would be more proof of willful (or, if you prefer, grossly negligent) mishandling of intelligence. More significantly, for Clinton's defense, they would show that Obama was complicit in Clinton's conduct yet faced no criminal charges.

That is why such an indictment of Hillary Clinton was never going to happen. The latest jaw-dropping disclosures of text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and his paramour, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, illustrate this point.

For the moment, I want to put aside the latest controversy - the FBI's failure to retain five months of text messages between Strzok and Page, those chattiest of star-crossed lovers. Yes, this ""glitch"" closes our window on a critical time in the Trump-Russia investigation: mid December 2016 through mid May 2017. That is when the bureau and Justice Department were reportedly conducting and renewing (in 90-day intervals) court-approved FISA surveillance that may well have focused on the newly sworn-in president of the United States. (Remember: The bureau's then-director, James Comey, testified at a March 20 House Intelligence Committee hearing that the investigation was probing possible coordination with Trump's campaign and Kremlin interference in the election.)

The retention default has been chalked up to a technological mishap. Assuming that this truly was an indiscriminate, bureau-wide problem - that lost texts are not limited to phones involved in the Trump-Russia investigation - it is hard to imagine its going undetected for five months in an agency whose business is information retention. But it is not inconceivable. Attorney General Jeff Sessions maintains that an aggressive inquiry is underway, so let's assume (for argument's sake, at least) that either the texts will be recovered or a satisfactory explanation for their non-retention will be forthcoming.

For now, let's stick with the Clinton-Obama emails.

Only July 5, 2016, Comey held the press conference at which he delivered a statement describing Mrs. Clinton's criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment. We now know that Comey's remarks had been in the works for two months and were revised several times by the director and his advisers.

This past weekend, in a letter to the FBI regarding the missing texts, Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) addressed some of these revisions. According to Senator Johnson, a draft dated June 30, 2016 (i.e., five days before Comey delivered the final version), contained a passage expressly referring to a troublesome email exchange between Clinton and Obama. (I note that the FBI's report of its eventual interview of Clinton contains a cryptic reference to a July 1, 2012, email that Clinton sent from Russia to Obama's email address. See report, page 2.) The passage in the June 30 draft stated:

We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including from the territory of sophisticated adversaries. That use included an email exchange with the President while Secretary Clinton was on the territory of such an adversary. [Emphasis added.] Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account.

On the same day, according to a Strzok-Page text, a revised draft of Comey's remarks was circulated by his chief of staff, Jim Rybicki. It replaced ""the President"" with ""another senior government official.""

This effort to obscure Obama's involvement had an obvious flaw: It would practically have begged congressional investigators and enterprising journalists to press for the identification of the ""senior government official"" with whom Clinton had exchanged emails. That was not going to work.

Consequently, by the time Comey delivered his remarks on July 5, the decision had been made to avoid even a veiled allusion to Obama. Instead, all the stress was placed on Clinton (who was not going to be charged anyway) for irresponsibly sending and receiving sensitive emails that were likely to have been penetrated by hostile intelligence services. Comey made no reference to Clinton's correspondent:

We also assess that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. [Emphasis added.] Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail account.

The decision to purge any reference to Obama is consistent with the panic that seized his administration from the moment Clinton's use of a private, non-secure server system was revealed in early March 2015. I detailed this reaction in a series of 2016 columns (see, e.g., here and here). What most alarmed Obama and Clinton advisers (those groups overlap) was not only that there were several Clinton-Obama email exchanges, but also that Obama dissembled about his knowledge of Clinton's private email use in a nationally televised interview.

On March 4, just after the New York Times broke the news about Clinton's email practices at the State Department, John Podesta (a top Obama adviser and Clinton's campaign chairman) emailed Cheryl Mills (Clinton's confidant and top aide in the Obama State Department) to suggest that Clinton's ""emails to and from potus"" should be ""held"" - i.e., not disclosed - because ""that's the heart of his exec privilege."" At the time, the House committee investigating the Benghazi jihadist attack was pressing for production of Clinton's emails.

As his counselors grappled with how to address his own involvement in Clinton's misconduct, Obama deceptively told CBS News in a March 7 interview that he had found out about Clinton's use of personal email to conduct State Department business ""the same time everybody else learned it through news reports."" Perhaps he was confident that, because he had used an alias in communicating with Clinton, his emails to and from her - estimated to number around 20 - would remain undiscovered.

His and Clinton's advisers were not so confident. Right after the interview aired, Clinton campaign secretary Josh Scherwin emailed Jennifer Palmieri and other senior campaign staffers, stating: ""Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it on the news.""

Scherwin's alert was forwarded to Mills. Shortly afterwards, an agitated Mills emailed Podesta: ""We need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov."" (That is, Obama had emails from Clinton, which he had to know were from a private account since her address did not end in ""@state.gov"" as State Department emails do.)

So how did Obama and his helpers ""clean this up""?

Obama had his email communications with Clinton sealed. He did this by invoking a dubious presidential-records privilege. The White House insisted that the matter had nothing to do with the contents of the emails, of course; rather, it was intended to vindicate the principle of confidentiality in presidential communications with close advisers. With the media content to play along, this had a twofold benefit: Obama was able (1) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and (2) to avoid using the term ""executive privilege"" - with all its dark Watergate connotations - even though that was precisely what he was invoking.

Note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions. But of course, that's not a problem if there will be no prosecution.

The White House purported to repair the president's disingenuous statement in the CBS interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of Clinton's homebrew server system through news reports - he hadn't meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email. This was sheer misdirection: From Obama's standpoint, the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account; the fact that, in addition, Clinton's private email account was connected to her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside the point. But, again, the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the White House's non-explanation.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch ordered Comey to use the word ""matter"" rather than ""investigation"" to describe the FBI's probe of Clinton's email practices. This ensured that the Democratic administration's law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the Democratic candidate's campaign rhetoric. If there was no investigation, there would be no prosecution.

In April 2016, in another nationally televised interview, Obama made clear that he did not want Clinton to be indicted. His rationale was a legally frivolous straw man: Clinton had not intended to harm national security. This was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed; nor was it in dispute. No matter: Obama's analysis was the stated view of the chief executive. If, as was sure to happen, his subordinates in the executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view, there would be no prosecution.

Within a few weeks, even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses - including Clinton herself - had not yet been interviewed, the FBI began drafting Comey's remarks that would close the investigation. There would be no prosecution.

On June 27, Lynch met with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, on an out-of-the-way Arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked.

Over the next few days, the FBI took pains to strike any reference to Obama's emails with Mrs. Clinton from the statement in which Comey would effectively end the ""matter"" with no prosecution.

On July 1, amid intense public criticism of her meeting with Bill Clinton, Attorney General Lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the FBI director and career prosecutors made about charging Clinton. As Page told Strzok in a text that day, ""This is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu."" It was also playacting. Page elaborated that the attorney general already ""knows no charges will be brought."" Of course she did: It was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution.

Knowing that, Lynch had given the FBI notice on June 30 that she'd be announcing her intention to accept Comey's recommendation. Fearing this just might look a bit choreographed, the FBI promptly amended Comey's planned remarks to include this assertion (which he in fact made on July 5): ""I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government. They do not know what I am about to say.""

But they did not need to participate in drafting the statement, and they did not need to know the precise words he was going to use. It was not Comey's decision anyway. All they needed to know was that there would be no prosecution.

On July 2, with the decision that she would not be indicted long since made, Mrs. Clinton sat for an interview with the FBI - something she'd never have done if there were a chance she might be charged. The farce was complete with the Justice Department and FBI permitting two subjects of the investigation - Mills and Clinton aide Heather Samuelson - to sit in on the interview as lawyers representing Clinton. That is not something law enforcement abides when it is serious about making a case. Here, however, it was clear: There would be no prosecution.

All cleaned up: no indictment, meaning no prosecution, meaning no disclosure of Clinton-Obama emails. It all worked like a charm . . . except the part where Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and the problem is never spoken of again.

163,191,baptistnews.com,political,https://baptistnews.com/article/what-is-sown-in-the-heart/,"A trip to the cardiologist is rarely routine. Usually a precipitating episode or a prior procedure prompts the appointment, and we are eager to receive a reassuring assessment. We know that the condition of the heart determines our health, and we listen with rapt attention to learn how we are really doing.

This past winter while teaching at Conception Abbey, I had a viral infection that mimicked some sort of heart trouble. Being taken to the infirmary in a male monastery was exciting for all concerned — monks and patient alike. I got to see parts of the monastery that are off-limits for women, so I dutifully closed my eyes (well, most of the time). Thankfully, all checked out well after a trip to a regional hospital and a follow-up with my cardiologist. Truly, I gained a new appreciation for my heart.

The Bible speaks of the heart frequently, making it the most common anthropological term in the Scripture. It is the vital center of a person, and it supplies the nourishment that is life-giving. In our time, we think the brain to be the center of human activity, directing the rhythms of an individual’s body; from the ancients’ viewpoint, the heart was the central organ that moved the rest of the body.

Scripture also speaks of the heart as the source of emotional, intellectual and moral activities. Thus, it plays a significant role in spiritual health, as the heart gathers up one’s whole being. It is the locus of faith; it orients a person’s life, and we should be wary of giving our heart to other than God. As Martin Luther said, belief is “that upon which we lean our heart.”

The Gospel reading for this coming Sunday includes the parable of the sower. Jesus speaks of varied responses to the word of the coming reign of God, and he warns how hard it is to be faithful to it, for “the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing” (Matthew 13:22). The word intends to rehabilitate the human heart, which can be “hardened,” “wicked,” “godless,” in biblical parlance.

When one broadcasts seed rather than carefully spaced planting, seeds can end up in varied contexts. Good soil can encourage growth, but rocky soil or a thorny patch or a trodden path make it very hard for the seed to bear plentiful yields. Varied elements conspire to keep the seed (the word) from accomplishing its true intent, to renew the heart by grace.

Responding to the word of God is not an easy thing, for it puts us at odds with the dominant culture of our world, which is all about acquisition, comfort and personal security. Jesus warns that the claim of this word is difficult: “When anyone hears the word of the basileia (the reign of God) and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart …” (v. 19).

Consumerist Christianity has performed a convenient work-around so as to ease the burden of Jesus’ claim. We have relegated his warning to the status of “interim ethics.” Jesus could only expect his followers to be radical in their fidelity because the world would soon end; he would return and rescue them from the challenge of living in a world of competing claims. He surely could not have meant for people to live in the economics of grace long term.

Wallace Hartsfield II suggests to his preaching students at our seminary that one who proclaims must find the original claim of the text on the hearer, the claim for the hearer today and the claim upon the preacher. This parable would make more sense in an agricultural setting; however, its pungent insights remain and call hearers of the word to examine their response and think about what issues forth from the heart, as well its chief longing.

I recently had the opportunity to write a blurb for an important book authored by Elizabeth Hinson-Hasty. In her forthcoming text, The Problem of Wealth, she challenges assumptions about why people are in poverty and calls for a new vision of community requiring economic justice. By delineating the problem when theology and economics are not integrally related, she is echoing the teaching of the parable. Wealth is the problem, she contends, for it tramples compassion for the economic other. Once again, it is a matter of the heart.

When the word of God takes lodging in our hearts, we are beckoned toward generative living, little satisfied with only the world’s goods. Where the heart is located and what fruit it bears makes all the difference for the treasure that is God’s emerging reign.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,What is sown in the heart – Baptist News Global,Molly T.

To the right is the Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.

Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democrat members of Congress joined with conservative evangelicals, including National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference President the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, to promote legislation to replace the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.

At a press conference held Thursday afternoon that featured Democrat and evangelical leaders, as well as several Dreamers, or young people affected by the rescinding of DACA, former House Speaker Pelosi stated there was ""nothing partisan, nothing political"" about the effort to replace DACA.

""We know we have to address some issues that relate to border security and we hope that we can do that in very short order,"" said Pelosi, adding that ""we take hope in the commitment of President Donald Trump"" to sign any legislation brought to his desk.

""We are proud to be with our Dreamers, who make America more American, with the hope, the determination, the optimism, the insistence on making the future better for the next generation. Those are American traits.""

In his remarks, Rodriguez, who gave a prayer at Trump's inauguration, explained that President Trump cares about the well-being of the children of illegal immigrants and wants to sign legislation securing their legal status.

""The president wants to make this happen. He wants to make this happen. He's a grandfather and a father. He has expressed that to me personally in the White House: 'I don't want to harm these kids. I want to make this happen,'"" said Rodriguez.

Rodriguez also spoke about the ""clarion call"" for border security coming from both the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress.

""The wall is a physical object created by man. 800,000 human beings created in the Image of God by God,"" noted Rodriguez.

""So if we have to build a wall in order to secure and save 800,000 lives, let's make that happen as expeditiously as possible ... let's build a wall, simultaneously saving 800,000 kids.""

Also in attendance for the press conference were Bishop Harry Jackson, senior pastor of Hope Christian Church, and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Last September, the Trump administration announced that they were rescinding the Obama-era DACA program, which temporarily protected immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children.

In a statement read to the press, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being ""rescinded"" as it was viewed as an unlawful unilateral action on the part of the previous administration.

""This policy was implemented unilaterally to great controversy and legal concern after Congress rejected legislative proposals to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions to this same group of illegal aliens,"" stated Sessions.

""In other words, the executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.""

The full rescinding of DACA was given a six-month delay so that Congress could pass legislation on behalf of those, commonly called Dreamers, threatened with deportation once the program was gone.

Earlier this month, federal judge William Alsup of San Francisco issued a temporary block to the administration's ending of DACA, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security's ""decision to rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise.""

""As a result, DACA recipients who failed to renew their status by last year's deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications. The decision does not, however, allow new applications to be submitted,"" reported the Hill.

Johnnie Moore, a religious freedom advocate and evangelical leader with strong ties to the Trump administration, helped to organize the press conference.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Moore explained that ""nearly every Republican, as well as @POTUS himself, believe this is the just thing to do.""

""It is the job of Congress to make laws & not according to their opinions but the opinions of their constituents. Our system demands compromise.

A Christian couple arrested for torture and child endangerment after their 13 children were rescued from their filthy home on the weekend only allowed the severely malnourished children to eat once a day and one shower a year, according to law enforcement officials.

""They were not being fed and they were living in filthy, dirty conditions. That's gonna take its toll,"" said Captain Greg Fellows of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department at a press conference.

The children of David Allen Turpin, 57, and his 49-year-old wife, Louise Anna Turpin, were rescued from their home in Perris, California, on Sunday after their emaciated 17-year-old daughter escaped and alerted police that her siblings were being held captive by her parents.

""Further investigation revealed several children shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings, but the parents were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner,"" police said in a press release.

What was even more shocking, they say, was that seven of the 13 victims who ranged in age from 2 to 29 were adults 18 and older.

An official with knowledge of the case told NBC News that the four-bedroom home where they lived was like a prison and reeked of urine. All of the children are reportedly being treated for severe malnutrition at local hospitals and doctors are worried they could go into shock. As soon as their conditions improve, psychologists are expected to be brought in to evaluate them.

David Turpin's 81-year-old mother, Betty Turpin, said it's difficult to believe what was happening in her son's house because she felt he and his wife were ""model Christians.""

""I feel they were model Christians. It's hard to believe all of this. Over the years, (only) the Lord knows what happened,"" she told the Daily Breeze. ""I'm not just a bragging parent. We raised two sons. They never gave us any problem, never got on drugs. ... (We) kept them in church. We never had to make them go to church.""

David Turpin's brother, Randy Turpin, who has been president of the Pentecostal Valor Christian College since 2015, has asked for privacy as he deals with the revelations about the family of his estranged brother.

""The Valor Christian College community joins with millions of Americans who are shocked and saddened by these terrible stories from California and we are praying for the full recovery of all involved,"" the Ohio school said on behalf of their president who has taken a sabbatical to deal with the family crisis.

Betty Turpin, who lives in Princeton, West Virginia, told the Daily Breeze that she vacationed with her son and his wife six years ago and she cannot reconcile the police report with her experience then.

""They are the sweetest family,"" she said. ""They were just like any ordinary family. And they had such good relationships. I'm not just saying this stuff. These kids, we were amazed. They were 'sweetie' this and 'sweetie' that to each other.""

Elizabeth Jane Flores, who is Louise Turpin's estranged sister, said she tried for years to get in touch with the children but their parents would not allow it.

""I want to reach out to the kids, I want them to know that for years we begged to Skype, we begged to see them, the whole family,"" she told ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" through tears.

""I was shocked because my sister and I haven't really had a sister relationship for about 20 years. So other than maybe like a call every once in a while, and sometimes those calls are like a year apart. So I was shocked, I was devastated,"" Flores said of the police rescue. ""We were never allowed to be a part of their lives.""

She explained that she lived with her sister and her family for a few months when she was in college. The Turpins, she said, only had four children at that time and the eldest was in elementary school.

""I thought they were really strict, but I didn't see any type of abuse,"" she said. ""Now that I'm an adult, I look back, I see things that I didn't see then.""

She recalled, however, that she had ""uncomfortable"" experiences with her brother-in-law but she never said anything because she was ""young"" and ""scared.""

""He did things that made me feel uncomfortable,"" Flores said. ""If I were to get in the shower, he would come in there while I was in there and watch me, and it was like a joke. He never touched me or anything.""

Despite the estrangement between her and her sister, she said she was praying for the family.

""I want her to know that she's still my blood and I love her. I don't agree with what she did and her actions have made the whole family suffer. But I want her to know that I'm praying for her salvation and that we do love her,"" said Flores.

Pope Francis has dismissed out of touch pastors leading double lives as a ""wound"" to the church which parishioners should not emulate.

""It's bad to see pastors with double lives. It's a wound to the Church. Sick pastors, who have lost authority and carry on with this double life. Jesus is stern with them. He not only tells people not to listen to them but also to not do what they do. What does He tell them? 'You're white sepulchers.' Beautiful in doctrine on the outside, but rotting within,"" Francis said in a strongly-worded homily at Casa Santa Marta on Jan. 9.

The pope warned that when pastors begin to lead double lives it is usually a symptom that their prayer life is weak and they have lost touch with the people they are supposed to be serving.

""This is the end of a pastor who is neither close to God in prayer nor close to the people in compassion,"" he said.

In November, Francis highlighted how Jesus warned his disciples about the scribes and Pharisees who ""tie up heavy burdens hard to carry and lay them on people's shoulders, but they will not lift a finger to move them.""

""This attitude is a wicked exercise of authority,"" he said, noting that spiritual leaders should lead by good example, ""helping others practice what is right and due, supporting them in the trials that they encounter on the path of goodness.""

When authority is exercised badly, the pope explained, ""it becomes oppressive, it does not allow people to grow and it creates a climate of distrust and of hostility, and also brings corruption.""

The pope's warning at the time came in light of a report that Indonesian bishop Hubertus Leteng had been accused by dozens of priests in the Diocese of Ruteng of having a mistress and misusing over $120,000 in church funds. He later resigned from his post.

The pontiff urged pastors who have lost their authority to not lose hope like the high priest Eli in the Bible.

Despite the failure of his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to live a life of righteousness, Eli still allowed them to serve as priests in the Tabernacle which angered God and the people of Israel.

""I say to the pastors who are detached from God and from the people, 'Don't lose hope. There's always another possibility. It was enough for a man to look and approach a woman, listen to her and awaken the authority to bless and prophecy.

""Accordingly, a son was born to her. Authority. Authority, a gift from God. It only comes from Him. Jesus gives it to His own. Authority in speaking, which comes from closeness to God and to the people. They always go together. Authority is coherence, not double life. It's authority, and if a pastor loses it, he should not lose hope, like Eli. There's always time to come close and reawaken authority and prophecy,"" Francis said.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Pastors Who Lead Double Lives Have Lost Touch With People, Are Wound to the Church, Pope Francis Says",,,[''],"Pope Francis has dismissed out of touch pastors leading double lives as a ""wound"" to the church which parishioners should not emulate.",,,

Baltimore Ravens tight end and pending free agent Benjamin Watson needed just two words to slam the nation's largest abortion provider for quoting the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the most revered civil rights activists of the 1960s.

On Martin Luther King Day Monday, Planned Parenthood, much like many other organizations in the United States, posted a tribute to the slain minister on its Facebook page.

Planned Parenthood shared a picture of King that features the word ""dream"" in big white lettering. Along with the picture, the abortion chain quoted King as saying: ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.""

""Today, we remember Dr King's legacy of resistance and commit to carrying the torch of courageous vision and action towards justice and equity.#MLKDay,"" the Planned Parenthood post reads.

The post by Planned Parenthood, which performs over 300,000 abortions every year and has been accused of unfairly targeting African-American and minority communities, didn't sit well with Watson, a devout Christian who has voiced his pro-life beliefs many times in the past.

Watson shared the Planned Parenthood post on his own Facebook page and offered two words in response: ""Just stop.""

The post comes as Watson gears up to speak to Christians gathered in Washington, D.C., this week for the annual Evangelicals for Life conference, hosted by the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.

In August 2016, Watson made national headlines after it was reported that he told Turning Point Pregnancy Resource Center in an interview that Planned Parenthood was created to ""exterminate"" African-Americans.

""I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions, and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it's kind of ironic that it's working,"" Watson said. ""We [as minorities] support candidates, and overwhelmingly support the idea of having Planned Parenthood and the like, and yet, that is why she created it.""

Watson also seemingly criticized minorities for buying into the abortion agenda.

""We are buying it hook, line, and sinker, like it's a great thing. It's just amazing to me and abortion saddens me, period,"" Watson explained. ""But it seems to be something that is really pushed on minorities and provided to minorities especially as something that they should do. In the public, it seems to be painted that when minorities get pregnant they need to get abortions, especially when it comes to teen pregnancy.""

""It's like when black girls are pregnant, it's like a statistic, but when white girls get pregnant, they get a TV show,"" he added.

Last January, Watson spoke to marchers at the 2017 March for Life. At the event, Watson called on those in attendance to make an impact within their own sphere of influence.

""This is the power of one. It is the power of influence, to influence people in our neighborhoods in our churches, in our workplaces on our teams,"" Watson said. ""It is also the power to unite as we have today as one, for a common cause to end the unthinkable practice of abortion in America.""

The number of Christians living in the Gaza Strip has massively declined, Church leaders have warned, hailing believers who choose to stay behind despite the hardships as being ""real heroes.""

Bishop Oscar Cantu of Las Cruces, New Mexico, told Catholic News Service earlier this week that people in the region are barely ""scrapping by"" because the area has been blockaded by Israel since Hamas, a terrorist group, controls the government.

What is more, only 130 Roman Catholic parishioners remain in Gaza, while not long ago there were 1,700, he said.

""The numbers of Christians in Gaza is dropping precipitously. It is just sad to hear, because obviously there is little to no opportunity for young people. There is little encouragement for them to stay,"" Cantu said.

Several church leaders celebrated mass at Holy Family Parish in Gaza on Sunday, as part of the annual Holy Land Coordination, where bishops from around the world meet with Israeli and Palestinian groups in an effort to promote peace.

Archbishop Stephen Brislin of Cape Town, South Africa, said it is understandable why many people are leaving Gaza, despite reconstruction work that's been ongoing since the 2014 conflict.

""The young people feel they must decide between staying in Gaza or leaving to find schools and jobs in other parts of the world,"" Brislin told CNS.

""This affects the Christian community. The young people who stay in Gaza are the real heroes. They are willing to sacrifice in order to create families and Christian life in Gaza.""

The challenges are massive, however, as young people face nearly 70 percent unemployment in Gaza.

Still, Brislin said it's imperative that the Christian community continues to exist in Gaza, which is known in the Bible as one of the places the Holy Family passed through on their way to Egypt.

""Basically, people are imprisoned. It can feel very claustrophobic ... for young people with a lot of dreams and hopes and potentials. And these potentials are broken because of the lack of opportunities,"" the archbishop warned.

Christians in Gaza have often found themselves caught in the crossfire of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, and have also faced struggles against the Muslim majority in the area.

Hundreds of believers staged protests in 2012, Reuters reports, and blamed Hamas-affiliated groups of kidnapping members of the Christian community and forcing them to convert to Islam.

Recently, many Muslims and Christians in Gaza came together to protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Al Jazeera, a news outlet controlled by the Qatari government, reported.

""Everyone we have spoken to here is in opposition to the U.S. move, and they say it only adds to the frustration of life here,"" Al Jazeera reported.

The plight of around 50 Indonesian Christians living in the U.S. but threatened with deportations by the administration of President Donald Trump has been likened by a federal judge to Jewish people fleeing the Nazis in World War II.

""We're not going to be that country,"" Judge Patti B. Saris said on Wednesday at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Boston.

""We don't want to put them on the ship unless someone"" can review their contention that deportation back to Indonesia is ""a really bad situation for them,"" she added, according to The Boston Globe.

Saris was referencing a case in 1939 when an ocean liner filled with 937 passengers, mostly Jews, left Germany for America, but was turned away by government officials. Hundreds of those Jews were reporedly later killed during the Holocaust.

Saris has ruled in favor of the Christians on a number of occasions against the Trump administration, and in November said that immigration officials do not have the right to carry out immediate deportations.

The believers fear that they will face persecution, torture, and possibly death if they are sent back home to the world's largest Muslim nation.

Most of the Indonesians came to the U.S. in the late 1990s and 2000s, fleeing anti-Christian violence. Although many overstayed their visas, U.S. authorities allowed them to stay based on certain conditions, such as checking in regularly.

They have been caught up in the net of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, however, and in August immigration officials told them they only have 30 days to get a plane ticket and depart the country.

Attorneys for the Christians are arguing that their clients deserve the right to at least challenge the deportation orders, and raise their fears of persecution with the Board of Immigration Appeals.

The Justice Department has argued that the Indonesians have not proven that they are likely to face persecution or torture if they are sent back home, however.

""Their assertion that 'all face a significant risk of persecution and torture if removed to Indonesia' is unsupported by facts that relate to any specific petitioner,"" DOJ lawyers have said.

Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who brokered the deal in 2009 that allowed the Christians to stay in seacoast communities in New Hampshire, has insisted that they do face significant religious persecution back home.

""Deporting these individuals will needlessly split families and communities, and put lives in danger. I'll continue to make every effort to prevent these deportations so that the Indonesian community can continue to live peacefully in New Hampshire,"" Shaheen said last year.

Meldy Lumangkun, one Indonesian Christian, told ICE officials in Manchester that there is also concern for the children.

""We are afraid to go home. We fear for the safety of our children,"" Lumangkun explained.

The Empowerment Temple church leader and social activist revealed in a video he posted on his Facebook page on Jan. 8 that he took umbrage to H&M's use of a black boy to model a sweatshirt with the slogan ""Coolest monkey in the jungle"" that was featured on the company's U.K. website and decided to join in a growing protest against the company for their insensitivity.

""I immediately at 6 o'clock this morning (Jan. 8) en route to the gym, posted on Instagram. That every person who is of conscience no matter what your color, should in fact be boycotting H&M because they do not appreciate our dollars and don't understand our depth and don't think highly enough of us to put us on their board of directors. #boycottH&M,"" Bryant said in the video.

Facebook also never had an African-American on its board until it announced Thursday that it will bring Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express, onto its board.

After about 4,000 people had approved his message on the social platform, Bryant said Instagram sent him a note saying: ""We have taken the liberty to delete your post because it does not promote harmony.""

A more diplomatic version of Bryant's controversial post is currently live on his Instagram page.

Many high profile public figures such as NBA star LeBron James and rapper Diddy have voiced their disapproval of the H&M advertisement. Singer Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as ""the Weeknd,"" has canceled his partnership with the company.

There has been intense global backlash over the advertising. At least two H&M outlets in South Africa were trashed by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party during anti-racism protests that forced the company to close all of its stores in that country on Saturday.

A Fortune report said the company announced Annie Wu as their new global leader for diversity and inclusiveness on Tuesday. She was already the global manager for employee relations.

""The recent incident was entirely unintentional, but it demonstrates so clearly how big our responsibility is as a global brand,"" H&M said in a message on Instagram. ""Our commitment to addressing diversity and inclusiveness is genuine, therefore we have appointed a global leader, in this area, to drive our work forward.""

Bryant charged, however, that despite the company's apology, it has no real commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Don't walk away from H&M just for today. Shut the door,"" he told his supporters. ""Save your apology H&M. The reason why it is that you are able to do it with clear conscience is that you are developing, you are manufacturing, you are warehousing, you are shipping all at the hands of black people but on your board of 12, you have not one minority sitting on your board.""",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Instagram 'Mistakenly' Deleted Pastor Jamal Bryant's Post Urging H&M Boycott, Company Says",,,[''],"More than a week after Instagram deleted a post from megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant for not ""promoting harmony"" because he urged a boycott of Swedish clothing retail giant H&M over racist advertising, an official from Facebook, which owns the application, said it was a ...",,,

172,201,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/the-truly-genuine-and-honest-signs-of-the-zodiac-ranked-from-most-to-least/,"While many of us know and understand our basic astrology sign and personality type, we often overlook how understanding astrology can benefit us socially. By better understanding the other signs, and their basic traits, we can also understand the type of person we are dealing with.

And if you weren’t born yesterday, it’s likely that you have met some pretty dishonest and fake people within your lifetime. Of course, these aren’t the worst people in the world, but they can be just as toxic within your life. So which zodiac signs are the most genuine and honest, and which ones are completely on the other side of the scale? Well, I am glad you asked.

If any sign from the entire zodiac is known for their complete honesty, it is the Sagittarius. Actually, the Sagittarius believes in morality and is against lying so very much that they may even offend you with how honest they are. While it may come off as brutal, they truly only mean the best.

2. Aries

Similar to the Sagittarius, the Aries is a sign of brutal honesty. If you do something stupid, they will tell you, with no holds barred. However, while the Sagittarius means well, the Aries is a little more offensive about it. But, don’t take it too hard, as it is just a major aspect of their personality.

3. Aquarius

Aquarius could possibly be considered one of the most genuine signs of the zodiac. Their honesty is rooted in their desire to be themselves, and due to this, they refuse to tell anything but the truth. Thankfully, in contrast to the Aries and Sagittarius, they are a bit more kind about it.

4. Libra

Libras are very passionate individuals with a high-level of morality. If they feel strongly about someone or something, they will become the most driven individuals in the zodiac. Because of this, they are also one of the most genuine.

Because of Capricorn’s very strong self-discipline, they are known for coming through on their word. To the Capricorn, their word should mean something and they will stop and nothing to make sure that it remains as so.

6. Cancer

Not only do Cancers say what they feel, but they also are able to maintain deep emotional bonds with other people, which they feel are truly important to them on a major level. Because of this, the Cancer lives their life as ethically as possible.

7. Scorpio

While Scorpio is one of the most loyal signs of the zodiac, they are also known for their honesty. However, while they are loyal and honest, their passion for others can also cause them to come off as jealous or possessive.

8. Leo

Leos, similar to Capricorns regard themselves highly and have much self respect. While they won’t outright tell a major lie, embellishing the truth is not beyond their scope of capability.

9. Pisces

As an intuitive sign, Pisces also has a sense of exactly how much they can get away with or what is better to keep hidden from the general public. Similar to Leos, they won’t tell an outright lie, but they will bend the truth a bit to protect themselves or others.

10. Taurus

The Taurus is a sign that can be a bit split. While they will readily provide you with factual information, they may censor themselves from telling the entire truth, or hold back entire scenarios for their own benefit.

11. Virgo

Virgo and Gemini are tied for the most dishonest. While Virgo can be a stickler in many ways, their overactive imaginations can lead to various lies. Sometimes, they may not even intend to lie to you, however, their imaginations kick in and create scenarios that aren’t entirely true.

12. Gemini

Finding themselves at the bottom of this list, it has been said that you can tell if a Gemini is lying by whether or not their mouth is moving. Furthermore, the Gemini will not only lie continuously, they may even lose track of their lies, leading to more and more lies until they are caught.

Monsanto has become the most inconsistent, public betraying, and health neglecting food companies in the entire world, and it is time to shut them down.

I’m sure each person reading this article has already read one or more articles about something Monsanto has done to the public. They genetically modify organisms and poison the people. Monsanto should’ve been shut down years ago, but now they really should. We know that Monsanto won’t be shut down though because they are among the chains of companies that rule the entire world.

Recently, some really interesting things were released about Monsanto and they are literally scrambling to bury it. Be sure to share so that Monsanto can be exposed once and for all.

The FDA registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of Monsanto’s weed killer Glyphosate. This chemical is also known as round-up. Following the tests they found incredible amounts of this dangerous chemical in all kinds of foods! Many of the foods were found to have over 1,000 times the safe amount! Here are the results.

It is really upsetting that we have to discuss the dangers of this chemical. But of course, some people will deny our integrity and assume that this chemical is harmless. Glyphosate is terrible for humans. It is weed killer, of course.

Glyphosate has even been linked to cancer. In 2015, the World Health Organization declared the chemical as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. The observation was based on animal tests, test tube studies, and observational studies. Mice and rat studies showed that the chemical produced the growth of tumors after the ingestion of the chemical.

A few of the cases were even linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that originates in white blood cells. This cancer cripples the immune system and will leave you for dead. Are we really okay will eating foods that are so likely to cause such a disease? The word is being ran by money hungry CEO’s, and they are neglecting our health. Stand up to Monsanto!

We share information almost daily about how to cure it and the things that cause it but could the cure to cancer really be this simple?

According to Gregg Braden, an American author when it comes to cancer therapy our minds play a much bigger role than we would initially think. How we feel significantly affects our DNA. He suggests that through the power of collective thought we could have a positive effect in treating all sorts of diseases, not just cancer.

Right off the bat, you may think this sounds like a load of bullshit and I could see why. However, this theory does not push that you need to be religious in order to do this, a matter of face you do not have to be religious at all for this to work. Braden believes there is a field that unites everything. This field he is referring to is one that has been scientifically proven and explained in the science journal Nature No. 332 back in 1996.

Now many are still quite skeptical about this but the video below as you will see shows this theory in action. In the video, you can see plain as day cancer being eliminated in about three minutes or less. The whole process is demonstrated over an ultrasound screen and is quite interesting to watch.

Braden says this works because of the strong electromagnetic radiation being produced during the video. He says that if you want to be able to do this yourself you will need to learn to focus and enhance your effects. This is something he claims lots of practice can show you how to do. What do you think about this?

176,205,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/she-was-surprised-to-find-such-a-large-egg-under-her-hen-cracks-it-open-to-strange-find/,"An egg inside an egg. Sounds tasty doesn’t? When one couple gathered some eggs from their hen, they came across a very large egg. It turned out that the egg was large for a good reason…it had another egg inside it. The video below shows the actual footage of what happens when the large egg is cracked open. In addition to a yoke and a white that you would normally see when you crack an egg, you see an entirely separate egg complete and still in its shell.

The egg owner is intrigued and goes on to opening the extra egg to see what’s inside it. It turns out this is a normal egg with the yolk and white intact.

Apparently, there is a name for such a phenomenon and an egg inside an egg is known as a counter-peristalsis contraction, which means that the egg that had already gone through the hen’s oviduct gets sucked back up before it has a chance to finish developing, thus allowing another egg to develop around it.

“Sometimes, if you have another ovulation before the first egg is laid, you have a ‘counter-peristalsis contraction,’ which means the oviduct will contract upward, and the first egg will be moved back up,” Poultry Science editor Gregory Bedecarats said. “When you see a tiny egg incorporated in a larger one, it means the egg was still present in the shell gland and got sucked back up the oviduct to where the other egg was having its white deposited.”

The result is a “mega-egg.”

The owner of the hen that laid this egg was worried that the hen didn’t die when the egg was coming out.

Because all those who were present for the big “mega-egg reveal” were too scared to eat the egg, the wife used it as an ingredient in her hair conditioner.

Commenters felt sorry for the hen that had to push the mega-egg out…

“Poor chicken that had to push that monster out hahaha.”

And they certainly found the humor in the case of the massive egg…

“Well, the question “which came first: the chicken or the egg?” should wait a little bit longer.”

Evidently, eggs aren’t the only thing that comes in doubles…

“I have seen that happen once before when my aunt had chickens. Also, cut a bell pepper open once and there was another tiny, fully formed, bell pepper inside it.”

When the family cracks open the egg it looks a bit like one of those Russian Nesting Dolls.

There is really no time like the week of Thanksgiving to dabble in these types of thoughts, which is why you are about to be enlightened by the truth behind that classic pumpkin pie holiday dish. Believe it or not, it wasn’t your grandmother who came up with the tasty dessert. While she may not like the fact that she is no longer deserving of the credit, rest assured, the original pumpkin pie was made far differently than the one that we know today.

And it was invented by the pilgrims!

Today, pumpkin pie looks like any other pie, brimming with a tasty filling and topped with sweet whipped cream. It’s top is smooth, its crust is hearty and it simply looks delicious. But, when the pilgrims first made this holiday favorite, it looked a lot different than what we know today. Instead of a smooth pie exterior, the recipe of the past looked more like a pie, literally inside a pumpkin.

If you feel like getting in touch with history this Thanksgiving, you can try out the pilgrims’ version of pumpkin pie…

-First, you are going to get a pie pumpkin. These aren’t your average carving pumpkins, instead they are a little bit flatter, with grooves on the outside. They are also known as sugar pumpkins, and are smaller in shape than the monstrous pumpkins you’d find at your typical pumpkin patch. Pie pumpkins are commonly found in the grocery store in the produce section or at farm stands. This small, round pumpkin is packed full of flesh that makes it a good choice for cooking. The pulp also has a better texture, is sweeter, and a lot less grainy.

-Slice off the top of the pumpkin and clean out the inside, scooping diligently with your hand until it’s free of the guts and seeds.

-Set the pumpkin on a cookie sheet and cover with foil. You will then bake it at 400 degrees until it’s tender. A fork should easily be able to cut through the outside. A 15 pound pumpkin takes two hours to reach tender status, so do the math and bake accordingly.

Now, it’s time to make the custard. For this, you will need…



-8 eggs

-1 cup brown sugar

-1 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin spice

-2 cans of evaporated milk (24 ounces)

-Whisk all custard ingredients together, until smooth and blended. It will be a liquid consistency.

-Use a ladle to remove any excess liquid from the inside of the pumpkin

-Pour the custard into the inside of the pumpkin.

-Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake the pumpkin for one hour or until the custard firms up.

Your end result should look like your pie pumpkin on the outside. When you cut into it, you will surprise your guests with a tasty custard filling. It definitely looks more festive than the pumpkin pies that we’ve been raised to know.

Maybe you will bring back an old classic to your family’s Thanksgiving table!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,I’ve Eaten It All My Life But Had No Idea This Is How It Was Supposed To Be Made [video],Robert Winthrop,,[''],,,,

In some cases, a recently expired can is still edible, but what about a product that is years beyond the expiration? Watch the video to see what a can of sweet corn, with a best used by date of August 1982, looks like when it’s opened by an employee of a food bank in Cardiff where the item was donated.

She runs a can opener along the top, which appears to be free of any dents or rust, and it makes a fresh pop as it’s cut into. Once open, you might be surprised to find that the corn looks every bit as fresh as a can that has not expired.

By all appearances, it’s fresh and bright in color, but does it pass the sniff test? While the woman smells it and doesn’t say it smells like it’s gone bad, she does note that it has a very strong metallic odor. Based on the long overdue date and the tin smell, she says it’s not okay for consumption. Needless to say, the vegetable doesn’t undergo a taste test, but if her reaction to the smell is any indication, it’s not going to taste very good.

Others noted that another item in the lineup of donated products was a Heinz kidney soup, which is a flavor that’s no longer made. The can is believed to be at least 46-years-old!

Helen Bull, the trust’s partnership and fundraising manager, explained the reason why they sometimes get older donations, noting: “Especially at harvest time people empty their cupboards of food they no longer need. It’s out of a generous heart but I just think they don’t think and don’t necessarily look at the dates.”

Of the Heinz can, she noted, “It would be great if anybody wants to give us lots of money for it. It should probably be in a museum.” The outdated can of soup even caught Heinz’s attention, as the company tweeted: “Wow! That soup was discontinued over 35 years ago. Should be in a museum rather than a food bank!”

As for what they do when they receive out-of-date food items, Helen explained: “Sometimes we do end up throwing quite a lot of food out. We get an awful lot of out-of-date food.”

These vintage cans, however, she said they will keep, saying, “It might remind people to give us in-date food.”

One commenter on The Mirror’s coverage of the story noted that they would likely have given the food a taste, saying:

“I would of tasted it. I reckon it would be fine…we in the UK eat with our eyes not our mouths/taste buds. Well not me. Stilton anyone!” Another noted: “I don’t look at dates. They said they found some corned beef from the Napoleonic wars which was still edible. That’s good enough for me. If it smells and looks OK?”

One commenter further noted that they’re “not that fussy,” explaining, “My mum gave us ketchup which was suspiciously dark (although we still ate it) – it was 15 years old. We also found a tin of condensed milk that was 20 something years old and tried it — looked dodgy, tasted fine! Mind you I love condensed milk so maybe I’m just not that fussy.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Food Bank Gets Donation, Realizes Can Is 35-Years-Old; Decides To Open It And Film What’s Inside",Wendy Michaels,,[''],,,,
179,208,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/farmer-shares-trick-to-keeping-strawberries-fresh-in-the-fridge-for-weeks-3/,"I don’t know about you, but I love getting fresh strawberries. When we have some time on a weekend morning, my wife and I make pancakes and put some sliced strawberries on top before dousing it with maple syrup. It’s a delicious breakfast item but hardly the only way to enjoy fresh strawberries. These versatile berries are good for many things from breakfast to dessert and even as an add-in to some salads. And if you’re like me, you like to stock your fridge with fresh fruits and vegetables.

And why should you? But strawberries can spoil and then you waste your money. However, expert farmers revealed a revolutionary tip to help you make your strawberries last longer.

Strawberries are a delicious way to add some nutrition into your diet. They’re loaded with Vitamin C, folate, potassium, fiber, manganese, magnesium and tons of cancer-fighting antioxidants. They’re a great way to get a much-needed nutritional boost.

Strawberries have been linked to improving brain function, boosting eyesight, reducing high blood pressure, decreasing symptoms of arthritis, and even lowering the risk of some cardiovascular diseases. If you’re not eating strawberries on a regular basis, you’re missing up on a great boost to your diet. You should definitely buy some this week. And after learning this tip, you’ll be able to ensure they last longer than usual.

While strawberries might be on sale some seasons of the year, they’re usually pretty expensive. So it’s a shame when you forget about them and then they spoil. It can sometimes deter you from buying them again. But don’t fear – there is a way to help them last longer.

Hip2Save shared a life hack to help keep your strawberries fresher in the fridge for longer.

To make your red berries last longer, you just need some white vinegar.

Simply mix one part white vinegar with 5 parts water in a large bowl. Think about using ½ cup vinegar with 2 ½ cups of water. Mix the liquids together then soak your berries in the vinegar mix for a few minutes.

After that, the strawberries shouldn’t spoil for a while. The vinegar helps get rid of mold spores and other bacteria that start to rot away the fruit before you’re ready to eat them.

While you might be a little squeamish around using vinegar, don’t worry – it doesn’t make your strawberries taste any different. Instead it just cleans them better than water alone.

Once you’ve soaked them in the white vinegar solution for a while, drain them out in a colander or a salad spinner. And when they’re all clean, pop them into a container and store them in your fridge like you normally would. But if you really want to make them last, dry them thoroughly then place them onto a paper towel inside your fridge.

Another tip: If you notice a moldy strawberry in the bunch, remove it immediately. This can help prevent the mold spores from traveling to other berries and running more of them.

Mindful of the fact that so-called ‘multiculturalism’ (when it consists of large numbers of Muslims) has been a failure in Europe, where most Muslims refuse to assimilate and the majority of refugees, who have little or no skills, will live on welfare benefits for most of their lives, Japan sees no need to cave in to international pressure to be more welcoming to refugees.

On the other hand, Japan is one of the world’s leading financial contributors to refugee assistance programs, as long as those refugees are not in Japan.

Business Insider (h/t Marvin W) Japan will limit asylum seekers’ right to work starting today, making changes to its refugee system that are likely to swell the numbers of those in detention centers, the justice ministry said, prompting refugee groups to flag humanitarian concerns.

The move to tighten one of the developed world’s toughest refugee systems, which accepted just ten during the period from January to September last year, is a bid to clamp down on what Japan views as a system of back-door immigration.

From Monday, the right to work is to be limited only to those Japan regards as bonafide refugees, while repeat applicants and those failing initial checks will be held in detention centers after their permission to stay in Japan expires, the justice ministry said.

“We want to focus on responding appropriately to refugees that need protection,” Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa told a news conference on Friday, adding that the changes do not mean the government will be reluctant to accept refugees.

Asylum seekers with valid visas now receive renewable permits to work in Japan while their refugee claims are reviewed – a system the government says has spurred people to seek asylum as a means of finding jobs.

With its shrinking population and high barriers to blue-collar immigration, Japan is grappling with the tightest labor demand in decades.

This has spawned a “gray” labor market, in which worker-strapped companies hire asylum seekers to make up the numbers, Reuters’ investigations have found.

The number of asylum seekers in Japan has risen steadily in recent years to a record, with more than 14,000 applicants between January and September last year, an increase of almost 80 percent from the year earlier period, ministry data shows.

About 60 percent of those asylum seekers would not qualify for work permits under the new system, said justice ministry official Tetsuya Hagioka, who oversees the refugee system.

The changes, which could lead to more detentions, will affect only those who seek asylum after Monday, Hagioka said, adding that current holders of work permits can continue working while their claims are reviewed.

Japan’s immigration detention centers held 417,383 people in 2016, the latest year for which data is available. The figure includes those detained more than once during the year, however.

Activists say cracking down on asylum seekers looking for work will not resolve the issue, however. “The abuse of the refugee system stems from the fundamental fact that Japan suffers from labor shortages and yet does not accept foreign workers,” said Eri Ishikawa, of the Japan Association for Refugees.

“We are greatly worried about the government threatening the asylum seekers’ livelihood without addressing this core issue.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Not only does Japan reject more than 99% of asylum seekers, as of today, it will curb asylum seekers’ right to work, despite the tight labor market","Don Spilman, Cleavis Nowell, Cleavisnowell, Clarence J.

Kristen Pyszczyk, a Toronto-based writer whose interests include “feminism, mental health, addiction, pop culture, and digital media”, claimed that having a child was not just a personal choice, but “a choice that affects everyone who inhabits our planet”.

She argued that the social media backlash the Gaineses have received represents “a conversation we need to have in order to challenge our uncritical acceptance of the life-fulfillment-through-procreation story.”

The main thrust of Pyszczyk’s piece is that Westerners should not be having children because they are bad for the environment.

“Population control is a fraught topic,” she admits, alluding vaguely to “nasty historical events” — but claims that it is “not an exaggeration to say that the survival of our species depends on it.”

“Shame is a powerful tool for changing behaviour,” she notes, suggesting that girls who are “groomed for motherhood from a very early age” should be subjected to “arguments for alternatives”.

However, she appears to contradict all of her arguments about climate change and individual carbon footprints at the conclusion of her article, in which the potential impact of falling Canadian birthrates is breezily dismissed with an appeal to mass migration.

192,227,bipartisanreport.com,clickbait,http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/22/supreme-court-makes-unanimous-ruling-against-the-trump-administration-details/,"Before the Trump administration finally found itself able to claim a significant legislative victory because of the tax reform plan in late 2017, the president marked his time in office by presiding over the shredding of as much pre-existing regulation as possible, no matter the cost.

One of the regulations up for the chopping block was the Waters of the United States rule, an Obama era move that formally extended the government’s authority to curtail pollution to small waterways.

The original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations.

In the aftermath of the rule’s implementation, interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government, and in one of them, the Supreme Court has just unanimously ruled against the government — in other words, against the Trump administration.

The ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself, but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question. The Trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges, while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue. The Supreme Court has now ruled unanimously in favor of industry interests in this case.

National Mining Association President and CEO Hal Quinn was thrilled with the outcome, commenting:

‘Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision provides much needed clarity and affirms our longstanding position that the Clean Water Act empowers the federal district courts, not the courts of appeals, to initially review legal challenges to the Waters of the U.S. Rule… This win, coupled with the administration’s actions in proposing to repeal the rule and seek input on how to properly define ‘waters of the U.S.,’ puts us one step closer to addressing this deeply problematic rule and the confusion it has created.’

The administration’s apparent legal incompetence on the matter of the Waters of the U.S. rule underscores an important point — Trump and his allies have proven themselves to be at least as concerned with industry interests as they are with protecting the environment. The fact of them not, apparently, knowing what they’re doing in this case correlates with a lack of concern.

The most infamous example of this apparent preference on the part of the Trump administration is the president’s abrupt announcement that he would be pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord last year. It is worth noting, however, that it requires more to pull the U.S. out of the accord than a single belligerent announcement from the president.

More recently, the Trump administration moved to open up offshore drilling around essentially the entire U.S., from California to Florida, a move immediately met with widespread criticism.

It remains to be seen how the rule change is implemented, if at all, and there has been talk of Florida being made exempt from the administration’s plans, although that’s not certain.

What is certain, however, is the Trump administration’s plans to prioritize U.S. business interests over other interests that the president is supposed to be looking out for as the leader of the country, indicated in everything from the president’s tax policy to his environmental policy.

At this time of year, peppermint hot chocolate, tasty bread and other baked goods, and other delectable items are available all over the place. Just walk into a Dunkin’ Donuts or another fast food restaurant, and you’ll be greeted with dozens of options to satisfy your holiday foodie itch.

But few companies have a monopoly on Christmas as strongly as Coca-Cola. Not only does the brand try to equate their soda with Santa Claus, but they’ve also been leaning into an environmentally conscious polar bear theme. Although these corporate polar bears have a much better gig than real polar bears that are constantly losing their habitat to climate change as the polar ice caps melt, Coca-Cola has pushed their version of these bears onto their customers to great appeal.

The Coca-Cola packaging now has polar bears illustrated on it during the holiday season to help celebrate Christmas.

But these corporate polar bears are hiding a secret in plain sight. While they first debuted on Coca-Cola packaging in 2016, they’re back for the holiday season in 2017. And they’ve got a big secret that some fans are starting to notice.

Take a close look at the images here. If you have a can of Coke at home, pick it up and put it under a magnifying glass. Can you see what the executives at Coca-Cola have infused into the image of the polar bears?

Reddit user sunkist268 noticed it and shared the observation online. The polar bears’ eyes are created out of Coca-Cola bottle caps. And their snouts’ sheen is shaped like Coca-Cola bottles. This is subliminal advertising at its finest.

When you see the secret image, you’ll be hitting yourself wondering how you never spotted it before. But Coca-Cola has master the art of subliminal advertising and has infused it into their campaigns for almost two decades.

Perhaps you remember when American Idol first debuted. Remember how the judges were sitting in chairs that looked just like Coca-Cola bottles? And they also sipped Coca-Cola during the show.

People remarked on the subliminal imagery on the polar bears. The following were some thoughts:

“Omg, I literally had to zoom in but when I did I experienced the magic of Christmas,” one replied.

Polar bears have been a part of Coca-Cola’s ad campaigns since 1993. These versions are new though.

“This year, we wanted to keep the same look and personality while creating a more graphic illustration style that would be easy to print around the world,” Frederic Kahn, Coca-Cola’s design director, told TODAY Food. “We also wanted to embed signature Coca-Cola elements so the Coca-Cola polar bears could immediately be recognizable as our asset.”

Coca-Cola knows how to influence the masses. And Kahn admits it was all planned out.

“When the bears are seen from the side, several have Coca-Cola dynamic ribbons as mouths, and we have some bears holding and drinking Coca-Cola from the contour bottle,” Kahn added.

194,229,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/farmer-shares-tips-to-pick-the-perfect-watermelon-from-the-supermarket-every-single-time-3/,"Is there a better summer fruit than watermelon? Of course not. Picking out the perfect watermelon at the store can be challenging though – how do you select a perfectly ripe watermelon that’s ready for your next picnic or barbeque? Turns out, it’s not nearly as challenging as you would think. Of course, everyone has their own technique to test out watermelons when they’re picking one at the store. This can include thumping the fruit, pressing on the outside to see if there’s a little give, and even sniffing the fruit.

If you’ve tried all of these techniques and still ended up shrugging and just grabbing a watermelon, hoping for the best when you get it home to cut it up, here’s a fail-proof way to pick out a ripe watermelon.

Look at the fruit’s field spot. The field spot is the lighter area of the melon where it rested on the ground when it was growing. It’s noticeably lighter because it’s been sitting in the field on that side. But how can that predict how ripe the fruit is? Most agree that choosing a watermelon with a golden creamy-yellow field spot means it’s the best fruit. The darker that color, the longer it was ripening on the vine and getting sweet. Avoid those that don’t have a field spot or that have a white spot, which means it was picked too soon.

Check out the webbing. While you might try and grab the watermelon that looks the most pristine, without any marks on it, there is actually something to the webbing, or lines, that you’ll see on the outside of the fruit. These scars indicate the number of times bees touched the flower while the fruit was growing and, with more pollination, the watermelon is typically sweeter.

Gender matters. Turns out, there are ‘boy’ watermelons, that are longer and taller, and ‘girl’ melons, that are shorter and rounder. The girls are sweeter, but the boys are more watery. Additionally, heavier watermelons have more water and are juicier.

Fruit size is a consideration. You may be inclined to pick the biggest watermelon you can heft, or assume that a smaller, more compact melon is sweeter. It’s best to choose a watermelon that’s neither too large nor too small, because the best ones are just average sized.

Does it have a tail? Whether or not the watermelon still has a stem intact can be a good indicator of ripeness. The ones with dried stems usually taste better than those with a green tail, which indicates it was picked too soon.

Those commenting on the YouTube video offered their experience with selecting a ripe watermelon, with one commenter explaining their personal experience:

“I actually used to work part-time at a farm where we used to pick watermelons when I was in high school. The knocking is not pointless. If you knock the watermelon in the middle and it sounds hollow like an empty wooden box, it is ripe. If it sounds like a solid noise it’s unripe. The farmer’s family taught us that they had been growing watermelons for 5 generations.”

And while they make total sense to the people in the religion, those looking at it from the outside might not understand. One particular religious rule for Muslims that other people don’t usually understand is their refusal to eat pork. But according to the first amendment, people are free to practice any religion they choose. But now a Muslim family from the New York area who were visiting the Decatur, Alabama area decided to stop for a bite to eat at a McDonald’s.

When they got there, they placed an order for 14 sandwiches. They handed over their money. But when they bit into their sandwiches, they found the McDonald’s employees at that location had hidden bacon in the sandwiches – consuming pork product is a sin in Islam. Now McDonald’s is under fire for their treatment of their Muslim customers.

The family took photos of their tainted sandwiches and shared them online. Before long, the Council on American-Islamic Relations jumped on board and accused McDonald’s of intentionally serving the Muslim family bacon as a cruel prank.

“They started noticing it tasted different to them,” said Khaula Hadeed, head of the Alabama chapter of the CAIR. “They eat McChicken all the time at McDonald’s [in New York]. They knew what they ordered — they know what’s in the sandwich.”

Hadeed sees this as a purposeful attack on the Muslim family.

“It doesn’t sound like a mistake, especially on 14 sandwiches,” Hadeed said. He went on to call the cruel prank “an intentional act of religious and ethnic bigotry.”

Because this Alabama McDonald’s location violated the family’s religion, Hadeed is calling for a full-fledge investigation into the employees there. The problem was so sever that one of the adults who accidentally consumed the bacon vomited twice.

“They’re essentially disturbed about it,” she said. “McDonald’s should investigate this incident, identify and terminate the employees responsible, and take proactive steps to satisfy this American family’s concerns, starting with an apology.”

The bacon was hidden in the sandwich so the Muslim family would have no way of seeing it but to accidentally eat it.

“One of the kids opened one of the sandwiches and it had bacon it ― like a very small, chunk of bacon in there. They were really surprised and kind of horrified,” Hadeed told HuffPost. “They opened all of them and, lo and behold, all of them had a small of chunk of crudely torn bacon piece in them ― either underneath the patty or on top of it in a way where you wouldn’t see it.”

But in March of 2016, the food company announced a voluntary recall of its popular product – Chunk Light tuna – because of a serious health scare.

A total of 31,579 cases of the canned fish were recalled in March after they were produced in February 2016 and distributed nationally.

Why were they calling back thousands of cans of tuna? Bumble Bee admitted a packing deviation by a facility not owned or operated by Bumble Bee that could result in contamination by spoilage or pathogens – if consumed this could lead to life-threatening illnesses…

Although no illness from the canned tuna were reported, Bumble Bee wanted to be on the safe side and voluntarily issue the recall before customers became sick.

The Bumble Bee Foods recall affected 3 specific UPC codes (8660000020, 8660000021, 8660000736) of canned Chunk Light tuna.

The recall is no longer active, but it’s best to be safe and check if any cans of tuna you have in your pantry could be effected.

Check for the can code which starts with a “T” (example: TOA2SBCABF) and have the following “best by” dates:

5oz Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna in Water – 02/10/2019, 02/16/2019, 02/17/2019, 02/18/2019, 02/22/2019, 02/23/2019, 02/25/2019

5oz Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna in Oil – 02/23/2019

4 Pack of 5oz Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna in Water – 02/9/2019, 02/10/2019, 02/22/2019, 02/29/2019

Because Bumble Bee wants their customers to be safe, they worked closely with the co-packer who developed the problem and the FDA to remove the product from store shelves.

If you have already eaten the product, then this is what you should do, according to Bumble Bee:

“Under-processed affected products could result in product contamination by spoilage organisms or pathogens and lead to serious illness if consumed. There have been no reports to date of any illness associated with these products.”

If you have any recalled product in your home, you’ve been advised to throw it away.

Bumble Bee urges: “Confirm that the product you have is one of the products listed above by checking the product and the lot code. Once you’ve confirmed that you do have a recalled product, please discard the product by disposing in the garbage.”

How do you feel about this massive recall? Readers on News10.com share their opinions in the comments:

“I have a rule I apply to myself, if major companies like Bumble Bee & Peter Pan do not control their food I never buy their products again. It is their responsibility to keep it clean. They are not potluck.”

“I don’t care if it is .59 cents or 3.59. If I have a can I want my money back. If everyone who bought a can decided not to return it that is a LOT of money we are just giving them.”

“I do have a BIG concern about throwing them away. What if who ever might find the can(s) knows nothing of this recall and eats them ? I read through the comments and didn’t see a thought on that scenario so. ????”

“Throw it away?? I paid for it and I would want a refund. Tuna isn’t cheap. Geez.”

“What about all the water the Japanese dumped on their radioactive plant when it was discharging radiation and had a meltdown. A lot of the tuna that we eat passed through those waters.”

Most days, Trump sets the tone for the day’s political conversations with an incendiary tweet, the exact contents of which vary from day to day, but range in how outrageous they are from being incendiary to being outright false.

In between these tweets, Trump sticks to essentially what defined him as a candidate, making grandiose promises and threats and even holding an occasional campaign rally, having filed to run for re-election in 2020 sooner into his first term than any other modern president.

He’s added threats like one to annihilate North Korea to his campaign-era arsenal of threats like the one to build a wall along the entire border between the U.S. and Mexico.

There’s at least one person on the inside who’s been reported to be far from impressed with Trump’s belligerence, even if ideologically it’s not as though he’s a moderate — retired four-star marine general John Kelly.

Trump tapped Kelly, who was at the time serving as Secretary of Homeland Security, to serve as White House chief of staff after the departure of Reince Priebus from the position.

In the months since, the relationship between the two men has evolved into something of apparent mutual tolerance, but even that may be fraying beyond repair according to reporter Gabriel Sherman.

Sherman reports that two “prominent Republicans in frequent contact with the White House” told him that “Trump has discussed choosing Kelly’s successor in recent days, asking a close friend what he thought about David Urban, a veteran Washington lobbyist and political operative who helped engineer Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania.”

The president’s daughter and unpaid adviser Ivanka Trump has been involved in the efforts to find a replacement for Kelly, according to Sherman.

In the words of one of his sources:

‘Ivanka is the most worried about it. She’s trying to figure who replaces Kelly.’

One important note from one of the sources is that Kelly wants to one-up his predecessor in terms of the length of his time on the job, so his departure likely isn’t “imminent.”

The fissure between Kelly and Trump has become obvious yet again in recent days and weeks.

Last week, Axios noted that Kelly had reportedly told lawmakers from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus that Trump had been “uninformed” when promising to build a wall along the entire border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Early the next day, Trump took to Twitter to rebut his chief of staff’s reported attempt at clarifying his boss’ remarks, writing:

‘The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.’

Ridiculously, Trump added yet another claim that Mexico will pay for the wall, although that remains a pipe dream at best.

Kelly also infuriated his boss with his claim that he had “evolved” in his views since becoming president, as yet another point indicating that Kelly will perhaps have a short future in D.C.

Were Kelly to leave, it would top off a first year in which the Trump administration set a record for senior staff turnover.

202,238,bipartisanreport.com,clickbait,http://bipartisanreport.com/2018/01/22/sarah-sanders-mocks-dems-over-government-shutdown-during-daily-press-briefing/,"Early Monday, the Senate finally came to an agreement on funding for the government for the next few weeks, allowing it to re-open while they continue to hash out various details of the controversy that ever prompted it to shut down in the first place.

Democrats want protections for the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children and have in the past been protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, while Republicans, as led by the president, continue to cast Democrats support for such protections as blind support for supposedly dangerous illegal immigration.

Throughout the whole ordeal of the first — and possibly not the last — government shutdown of the Trump administration, the White House has maintained that the Democrats were both fully responsible for the situation and had essentially no legitimacy to their position. The administration issued a ridiculous statement at one point calling Democrats “obstructionist losers.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders continued on with this rhetoric at the Monday White House press briefing, mocking Democrats for sticking to their positions to the point of letting the government shut down instead of blindly going along with Republicans.

A reporter asked her:

‘In addition to saying that negotiating with [Trump] is like negotiating with Jell-O, today [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer] said that the great dealmaker sat on the sidelines. Was it a concerted effort on the president’s part to not reach out to him this weekend?’

Sanders responded by saying that “what the president did clearly worked,” seeing as the federal government is set to re-open on Tuesday.

As she put it:

‘I’m not sure what changed for [Schumer] and what he gained, other than maybe Nancy Pelosi taking a bunch of Republican members out for dinner to celebrate their shutdown. I’m not sure what other positive things came out of this weekend for Democrats.’

Sanders meant that Pelosi took out the Democrats out for dinner.

Besides her mistake — something borne out of the mindlessness with which she was mocking Democrats — she’s wrong about Democrats not getting anything out of the weekend of turmoil. Republican leadership promised to take up the issue of the DACA program within three weeks, and at the same time, funding was finally renewed for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, which Republicans had allowed to languish without funding for some time.

Even in the face of those concessions from Republican leadership, some Democratic U.S. Senators voted against re-opening the government without establishing continued protections for those provided for under DACA now.

Those Senators to do so include Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and others.

The president, for his part, has not yet commented on the Senate coming to an agreement to reopen the government, although he did rant about the shutdown early Monday on Twitter.

He varied between the line that it’s all the Democrats’ fault and the line that it’s all the Democrats’ base’s fault.

Following his address to the troops, Pence went to Israel, where he spoke to the Israeli parliament, where he told those assembled that the president would ensure the U.S. Embassy in Israel moved to Jerusalem by the end of next year.

Pence’s comments come after the president made the incendiary, controversial move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, even though the status of Jerusalem is one of the items at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Effectively taking Jerusalem off the negotiating table serves as yet another obstacle in the way forward for the Middle East.

After speaking to the Knesset, Pence spoke to the Associated Press, defending his boss President Trump both from allegations of racism and of an extramarital affair with adult film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels.

The allegations of racism against the president arose after, following a recent meeting between the president and lawmakers about immigration policy, Trump was reported to have referred to countries including Haiti, El Salvador, and some African nations as “shithole countries.”

Trump eventually offered a relatively halfhearted denial of the allegations, although national leaders and meeting participants backed up press reports about what the president had said.

Addressing the president’s alleged comments while speaking to the AP, Pence claimed that it’s clear that Trump’s “heart” is in the right place because of his vocal commitment to a merit-based immigration system over the presently in place, more family and national origin based immigration system.

Pence said that he knows “the president’s heart” and knows “that what President Trump wants to do is reform immigration to make our system one that puts the interests of America first.”

Trump has touted his commitment to the idea of a merit-based immigration system numerous times, including in the aftermath of the meeting wherein he was reported to have made the “shithole countries” remark.

The idea of a merit-based system sounds nice to Trump and Pence, no doubt, and claiming to “not see race” gives them an easy out when accused of being a racist, but it’s not that simple.

Who is going to be the judge of what “merits” an immigrant has? What if their “merits” can only be fully realized once they have access to the opportunities available in the United States?

Considering these questions in light of the president’s commitment to such policy proposals as the U.S./ Mexico border wall and the Muslim ban makes his intentions clear — he simply wants people who will conform to his vision of the United States.

As mentioned, Pence also addressed the allegations of Trump having had an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who is alleged to have been delivered a large sum of hush money by the Trump team.

Speaking of these allegations, Pence said:

‘I’m just not going to comment on the latest baseless allegations against the president. My focus is on serving the president, advancing the priorities of the administration, advancing American interests and that’s where it will stay.’

To that end, last May, the president abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the federal government’s component of the Russia investigation at the time. In the aftermath of that firing, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate the Russia scandal. Since then, Mueller has brought charges against four former associates of the president, including most recently, former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Understandably, then, the Trump team remains interested in softening the bite of the nation’s justice system. Trump has put this tendency on display numerous times through attacks on the nation’s justice system, including his already mentioned firing of James Comey.

Now, Axios is reporting that behind the scenes, Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions has joined in on the effort by trying to convince the man with whom the White House replaced Comey — Christopher Wray — to fire top level Justice Department officials including Andrew McCabe and James Baker.

Sessions has been casting his pushes as encouraging Wray to make a “fresh start.” According to one of the sources speaking to Axios — described as a “senior administration source” — Sessions has been pushing the FBI Director to make the transition since “shortly after Wray was confirmed,” with the conversations having “intensified from there.”

McCabe has actually already attracted scrutiny from the administration in the past, having been the subject of fake news-laden Twitter attacks from the president last summer while serving as Acting Director of the FBI after Comey’s firing and before Wray’s confirmation.

As Axios notes, it’s ironic that Trump set his sights on McCabe after it was his administration that appointed him to serve as Acting Director of the FBI.

Back in late July, Trump wrote on Twitter:

‘Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife’s political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!’

As mentioned, Trump’s attacks on McCabe, which stretched over a period of days, were riddled with lies.

McCabe didn’t actually receive any of the Clinton associated cash — cash, that mind you, didn’t come from the Clinton camp, but rather from a Clinton ally.

In addition, McCabe wasn’t actually the one “in charge” of the Clinton email investigation; if someone was “in charge,” it was then-FBI Director James Comey.

Still, Trump has long made his opinions about the Clinton email investigation clear. He wishes that Clinton would have been charged with a crime, even though the orderly legal system already determined that she was innocent.

He was speaking against McCabe out of that place of total disrespect for law and order, which makes his haphazard treatment of the truth unsurprising.

Following his initial attacks on the official, McCabe was reported to be considering retiring after he became eligible for a pension, and the president hit him over that too.

As for Jeff Sessions, he was actually revealed to have secretly met with the then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. during the Trump campaign and thus, as a possible subject of the investigation, had to recuse himself from the Russia probe.

Sessions reportedly having pushed Wray to fire top staff members doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s violating the terms of his recusal, but it’s still suspicious meddling in the affairs of the FBI, which Trump and his allies seem convinced is out to get him.

And while they obviously sensed something about this practice on a spiritual level, science is finally starting to catch up.

If you aren’t aware of what smudging is, it is a practice in which Native American’s and other spiritual traditions would bind herbs (like sage) together with string and then set them to fire enough to produce smoke. The smoke would then be used to cleanse areas of evil or negative energies and to cleanse people pre-ritual as well.

In a recent paper entitled ‘Medicinal Smokes’, information was reviewed from over 5 continents and 50 countries. What scientists discovered was that not only does smudging aid lung, brain and skin function, it also does indeed purify the air around us.

A follow-up study was conducted not long after that was published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology.

According to it, smudging sacred herbs also doubles as a powerful antiseptic.

“We have observed that 1 hour treatment of medicinal smoke emanated by burning wood and a mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs (havan sámagri=material used in oblation to fire all over India), on aerial bacterial population caused over 94% reduction of bacterial counts by 60 min and the ability of the smoke to purify or disinfect the air and to make the environment cleaner was maintained up to 24 hour in the closed room.

Absence of pathogenic bacteria Corynebacterium urealyticum, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter aerogenes (Klebsiella mobilis), Kocuria rosea, Pseudomonas syringae pv. persicae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. tardicrescens in the open room even after 30 days is indicative of the bactericidal potential of the medicinal smoke treatment.

We have demonstrated that using medicinal smoke it is possible to completely eliminate diverse plant and human pathogenic bacteria of the air within confined space.”

Basically, burning sacred or medicinal herbs cleared the air of bacterial populations by as much as 94%. Even 24 hours later, the area was still disinfected. Scientifically, the air quality in modern times contains up to 1800 bacterial types, many of which are pathogenic.

While we still may not have all the evidence backing smudging’s spiritual aspects, it has been shown that smudging is quite effective at combating bacteria. With strains of bacteria growing to be anti-bacterial resistant on a moment to moment basis, it’s obvious we can use all the help we can get. With that being said, excuse me while I go grab my smudge stick!

207,244,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/how-spirituality-could-be-the-key-to-coping-with-mental-illness/,"With a number of people now identifying as spiritual rather than religious, researchers have begun investigating to better understand how spirituality plays a role in the modern life. And while we all may understand that spirituality somehow just makes us better, science is beginning to prove it.

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 1 in 5 adults in the U.S.-43.8 million or 18.5% experiences mental illness in a given year. Due to these astoundingly high numbers, experts have begun to seek answers to this crisis in all walks of life.

And with spirituality playing such a major role in many people’s lives, researchers began to wonder whether or not spirituality could aid in the treatment of mental illness.

In order to put this into perspective, it is important to understand what exactly spirituality is. While there is no one definition, there are a number of ways to better understand what spirituality truly means. For starters, spirituality is an individual experience that any person can take part in. It helps to bring meaning and purpose to the lives of those experiencing it. Furthermore, spirituality can bring hope and healing to those who are suffering. And it can encourage us to seek out a loving relationship with ourselves.

Spirituality is also different from religion. While religious traditions include spirituality, spirituality is separate from religion. In fact, in order to be spiritual, religion isn’t even necessary.

What’s more, is that scientists are beginning to understand that spirituality could be paramount in helping the mentally ill to combat their illness. According to the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, there are many links between spirituality and recovery from their illness. In one study, it was discovered that spirituality helped children from smoking, drinking and drug abuse, by combatting the impact of life stresses.

In another study, researchers monitored three groups of people, one with psychotic illness, another group of formal caregivers, and the third group of informal caregivers. While those that were ill held their existential needs as most important, the groups of caregivers considered their material needs to be most important. With that being said, another study found that the majority of parents with a child sick with mental illness felt that spirituality was important in the treatment of their children and wanted spirituality to be included in their treatment.

So how exactly does spirituality help those who are suffering? While researchers aren’t entirely sure, they believe it has to do with the connectedness to something bigger than yourself which can make coping with mental illness much easier. In a way, it helps them to make sense of what they are experiencing.

With spirituality holding such an important role for the mentally ill, where can we begin to incorporate it into our treatments?

While you don’t have to run to your nearest spiritual guru to benefit from spirituality, there are a number of ways you may benefit from it.

NAMI suggests seeking times of relaxation or even meditation in which you focus on places, people, and experiences that give you feelings of peace, awe or greater meaning.

For some, finding peace in nature can greatly benefit them, and for others, something as simple as listening to a meaningful song can help. If you are already a spiritual person, just incorporate your favorite practices into your treatment plan. Personally, I enjoy using crystals and incense to aid in coping with my illness.

(Natural News) A State Public Health Emergency has been issued in Alabama by Governor Kay Ivey as a flu outbreak grips the state. Schools are closing and hospitals are filling up as the flu vaccine proves to be a spectacular failure yet again this year.

Hospital emergency rooms and outpatient clinics are reporting a very high volume of patients. Children’s of Alabama has issued a diversion protocol as they’ve run out of beds, instead requesting that patients are diverted to a different pediatric hospital. In addition, they’ve announced that they may transfer some of their patients to other hospitals to provide everyone with the best care possible.

UAB Hospital, meanwhile, is rescheduling elective, non-emergency surgeries because it is over capacity with flu patients.

FBI Investigation of Clinton Foundation Expands to Australia

(Mark Tapscott, Lifezette) An Australian investigative journalist who is a retired police detective said Tuesday he has been asked to provide the FBI with details about multiple allegations of mishandling millions of dollars contributed to the Clinton Foundation by the Aussie government.

“I have been asked to provide the FBI with further and better particulars about allegations regarding improper donations to the CF funded by Australian taxpayers,” Michael Smith told LifeZette.

At the center of Smith’s complaints are former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and multiple Australian government officials, including senior diplomat Alexander Downer, that government’s high commissioner to the United Kingdom.

Downer hit U.S. headlines recently when he was reported to have told the FBI of a May 2016 conversation he had with George Papadopoulos, then a campaign aide to President Donald Trump. Downer told U.S. law enforcement officials that Papadopoulos told him Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.

** MORE CLINTON FOUNDATION COVERAGE at Liberty Headlines **

The New York Times claimed in its Dec. 30, 2017, story that the information Downer gave the FBI was a major factor in the bureau’s decision to investigate allegations of collusion between Russian interests and the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year.

The materials Smith is giving the FBI focus on a 2006 memorandum of understanding between the Australian government and the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton HIV/AIDs Initiative (CHAI). Smith claims the foundation received a “$25M financial advantage dishonestly obtained by deception” as a result of actions by Bill Clinton and Downer, who was then Australia’s minister of foreign affairs.

Also included in the Smith materials are evidence he believes shows “corrupt October 2006 backdating of false tender advertisements purporting to advertise the availability of a $15 million contract to provide HIV/AIDS services in Papua New Guinea on behalf of the Australian government after an agreement was already in place to pay the Clinton Foundation and/or associates.”

NY Times: Hawaii Panics After Alert About Incoming Missile Is Sent in Error

By ADAM NAGOURNEY, DAVID E. SANGER and JOHANNA BARR

REBUTTAL BY

The people of Marxist-Globalist Hawaii were terrorized this past weekend when an early-morning emergency alert “mistakenly” warned of an incoming missile attack. The cellphone and TV alerts, sent by the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HEMA), set off widespread panic in a state that was already on edge because of the imaginary threat of North Korea. According to the “official story” put out by HEMA, as quoted in this article: “Someone clicked the wrong thing on the computer.”

Oops. Hey, we all make mistakes — no biggie (rolling eyes).

https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HawaiiAlert.jpg http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/01/15/Pictures/hawaii-mistaken-missile-alert_57202c3c-f9a1-11e7-b07f-b94dbb2f1d8d.jpg http://grassroots.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Oops-Didnt-Get-It-Inspected.jpg

A simple “oops” caused 38 minutes of terror? Seriously?



The “oops” story simply does not add up. Alert systems such as this are multi-step procedures — not a simple “push button” thing. And if the alert was truly the result of “pushing the wrong button,” then why was it not immediately rescinded? Why did it remain in place for 38 long and terror-filled minutes after it was issued? Could it be that the alert was real? Could it be that an actual submarine attack — intended to put the blame on North Korea and trigger the war that Trump is actually trying to avoid — was thwarted by “the White Hats” on Saturday? Sound crazy to you? Well, it’s a heckuva lot more plausible-sounding that the idea of an “oops” alert — a colossal screw-up unprecedented in American history.

Now, who would dare to attempt such a horrible false-flag? Who, other than the world’s main superpowers, even possesses such submarine missile-launch capacity? This is only a hypothesis, but certainly a much more reasonable one than “oops.” In fact, we have been warning about such a scenario for a few years now. Flashback time: From The Anti-New York Time issue of April, 2017 (here)

***************************



“As it is in Syria, so too it is in the Korean peninsula. We are just one Israeli false-flag attack from being stampeded into another “Remember the Maine” moment. Such a stunt would actually be easier to pull-off under Korean waters than on Syria’s land. You see, Israel’s state-of-the-art submarines, sold to them at a deep-discount by the pathetic Germans, have the capacity to prowl all of the world’s waters and even launch missiles. Who would dare to accuse “our ally” of taking out an American vessel in Korean waters? Or of hitting Hawaii? No, sir. That would be “anti-Semitic,” don’t you know?



We are not predicting this nightmare submarine scenario. Suffice it to say that the arrival of American warships in Korea and China’s front yard will be an event fraught with danger on many levels.”

The public has already been conditioned to fear North Korean submarine and missile attacks. Who would ever suspect Israel?

*End of flashback



One year before that article, in 2016, in a TomatoBubble piece titled, “Japan and Israel Plot Against China and North Korea” (here) we warned:



http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-358552-thumbflex-tudg-358552.jpg http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/01/F160112KBG04.jpg http://www.vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/h_52063895.jpg

Once the game pieces have been set, a single false-flag torpedo blast from one of Israel’s state-of-the-art German-made, nuclear-armed submarines could serve as the match which ignites the Pacific and draws Judaized-America into something horrific.

***************************



*End of flashback

We will not declare “nailed it” this time because A: This stuff is far too deadly serious to even give the appearance of gloating about, and B: We cannot declare Israeli treachery with 100% certainty. It’s quite possible that the Globalist faction of the CIA has its own submarines and missiles. Another possibility is that a false alarm — with no submarines involved. — was triggered at HEMA in the hopes of inducing a U.S. first strike (leading to a North Korean retaliation). All that we will say is that we ain’t buyin’ this “oops” explanation. No way. And what makes this strange event all the more suspicious is that it came just weeks after numerous Fake News warnings of a “missile threat” to Hawaii. Here are just a few examples:

Newsweek (December 17, 2017): Hawaii Taking Major Steps To Prepare For Potential Strike From Kim (here)

Washington Post (Decemeber 1, 2017): Hawaii Tests Nuclear Alarms as North Korea Threat Escalates (here)

Los Angeles Times (November 10, 2017) As North Korean Threat Grows, Hawaii Prepares for Nuclear Attack (here)



That’s known as “predictive programming,”

“The kidnapping occurred on a Friday around 10.30am. It was broad daylight and whoever abducted him risked being seen from the balcony of William’s grandmother’s home as well as neighbouring properties.”

The details of William’s time in foster care were only revealed late last year after the NSW Supreme Court overruled FACS and ordered William’s family history could be published.

His foster parents have asked not to be named to protect the identity of William’s siblings. Ms Collins labelled them “strict”.

“Karlie and Brendan could see William for one hour every seven or eight weeks at the Macquarie Centre,” she said. “The last time they saw him, William yelled ‘Daddy, Daddy, Daddy’ and jumped out of the pram like a kangaroo.”

Ms Collins is asking authorities to provide Brendan with the help he needs to return to “his normal self”.

Schapelle Corby has used her the media circus surrounding her departure from Bali to draw attention to missing Australian boy William Tyrrell.

Corby was flanked by security, police and media as she left her Kuta home, where 7 News images showed her holding a handbag with an image of William Tyrrell on it.

It has been two years since the three-year-old wearing his Spider-Man outfit disappeared from his grandmother’s house at Kendall in New South Wales on September 12, 2014.

Police believe he was abducted and earlier this year they offered a $1 million reward for any information that leads to his recovery.

I’m sure i’ve seen a link between Ballarat priests, Pell, and Risdale, with Spedding I’ll keep digging.

Full story: Father Ridsdale’s life of crime — and the church’s cover-up

Background article, by a Broken Rites researcher

This Broken Rites article is the most comprehensive account available about how the Catholic Church shuffled a paedophile priest, Father Gerald Ridsdale, from parish to parish for three decades while he committed sexual crimes against children. Broken Rites has been researching Ridsdale since May 1993, when he famously walked to court for his first sentencing, accompanied by his support person, Bishop George Pell. Broken Rites began supporting Ridsdale’s victims, resulting in four more court cases for Ridsdale between 1994 and 2017 (without the presence of George Pell).

The famous 1993 photo

On every page of the Broken Rites website (in the right-hand column), there is a photo of Father Ridsdale (with his features obscured by dark glasses and a cap) walking to the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 27 May 1993 with his support person, bishop George Pell (wearing clerical garb). This was the day when Ridsdale received his first conviction for child-sex crimes. [In 1993, Pell was an Auxiliary Bishop for Melbourne, and three years later he became the Archbishop.]

By 27 May 1993, unknown to Ridsdale and Pell, one of Ridsdale’s victims had alerted the media that Ridsdale was due to appear in court that day for sentencing. Therefore, when Pell and Ridsdale approached the court building, a Channel Nine camera man obtained video footage of their arrival.

That evening, Channel Nine’s news bulletin showed this footage of Father Ridsdale and Bishop Pell arriving at the court. This bulletin was viewed throughout the state of Victoria, including by many church-abuse victims. Viewers noticed that a bishop was accompanying the criminal priest, rather than accompanying the victims.

Bill Spedding faces historical sex offences

The top suspect in the case of missing toddler William Tyrell, NSW man Bill Spedding, is facing historical child sex offence charges in a Victorian court. Vision: Seven News

The 65-year-old is facing five indecent assault and two sexual intercourse with a child under 10 charges.

It is understood the alleged offences date back to the 1980s and relate to a girl Mr Spedding knew.

Spedding, a white goods repairman from the NSW Mid North Coast, was thrust into the spotlight last year after emerging as a person of interest in the high-profile William Tyrrell investigation.

Three-year-old William disappeared while playing in his grandmother’s backyard in the small town of Kendall, near Port Macquarie, on September 12, 2014.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott gave a personal reference in court for the former priest Father John Nester in a child sex abuse case in 1997. Father Nester was later struck off as a clergy by the Vatican. Add this to Tony Abbott’s and the Liberal Party’s extremely close relationship with Cardinal George Pell who has admitted the church covered up sexual abuse

https://kangaroocourtofaustralia.com/2013/09/15/tony-abbott-and-his…

So to sum up. Nester, Risdale, Pell and Abbott (Ex PM and NWO Stooge) All were in Ballarat around the same time in the 80′s. Nester and Abbott knew each other well and Abbott gave him a reference at a sexual abuse hearing in 97. Presumably he knew Risdale and Pell also.

Pell, now the popes treasurer was also in the picture around Ballarat, and he has also been charged with sex offences dating back to this time. For him they are labeled “Historical sex offences”, for Risdale and Nester its just notorious paedophile.

“Cardinal Pell is facing multiple charges in respect of historic sexual offences and there are multiple complainants relating to those charges.

http://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria-polices-full-statement-conc…

I can’t find much on the charges themselves like when or where they occured but it appears that plenty of that sort of thing was going down in Ballarat and anywhere these priests worked, except Tony Abbot who just knew them.

Spedding was also in the area of Ballarat in the 80′s and appears to be a person of interest in the disappearance of William Tyrell.

Is it possible he knew the other convicted Paedophiles Nester and Spedding, as well as Accused Paedophile Pell

Now we find out there is a shit load about this case that took years to come out that would change the focus of the investigation possibly. This child was in state care but no one was told at the time and the “parents” were paraded around mortified, but,It seems they hardly knew him, and no one told anyone, Why?

The biological parents are not suspects.

Pretty strange…..OK, So the only link between Spedding, Risdale and Nester is they they were in the area where this happened around the same time doing similar reolting things but “Small World”

Pell (Vatican No2 or some shit) assisted Nester then dismissed the victims for years.

Abbott (Ex PM) Wrote reference for Risdale when he went to court for Paedophilia.

If theres nothing in it why did they cover so many things up about the abduction itself?

How did he go missing without anyone seeing anything. Its possible but doesn’t the fact that the “Parents” he was with were in fact “Foster parents” and as such likely to go up the suspect list. No one suspects the biological parents in a case like this with the exception of Maddie Mcann.

Less questions about the unlikely circumstances of the actual disappearance itself?

Why were the children taken from there biological parents and felt they had to hide from welfare for months only for the department to lose the child under these horrific circumstances. The answer is sealed, but they say the real parents didn’t abuse him in any way so what was going on?

Following the revelations of paedophilia at the highest political levels including prime ministers and presidents, George Bush etc.

Small world, come to your own conclusions.

Walls: A History

The Hopi creation story of this world begins as the last world was ending in some nonspecific calamity. A few people were taken underground, saved by ant people. The ant people took our ancestors underground and taught us how to survive, how to grow food and hide from disaster. Eventually people returned aboveground to and were told to walk the four directions and reunite.

At first the creation story such seems like many indigenous tales, but comparatively and allegorically speaking the Hopi creation story approaches perfection in its eloquence. Ants are the only animal in the world that humanity can be accurately compared with so much so that perhaps mankind was influenced by ants more than any other being. Humans and ants are farmers, warriors, harvesters, thieves and enslavers alike. No other animal behaves like man, except ants, no other being is as warmongering. Individually we each might be more like a dog or cat, or perhaps we might like to see ourselves as similar in character to a bird, but as a collective mankind is like antkind.

Human history in total, from whatever nationalistic, religious or otherwise jingoistic perspective one endures can be read like a proud Argentine Ant’s recital of the invasion of New Orleans, and California. The Argentine Ant spent millions of generations building up not only defensive structure, but amassing invasion forces to take over as much of South America as antly possible. Any other ant colony they encounter, they destroy. They vanquish all other antkind and if ants believe anything at all, they must believe they are the chosen ant. Ants are extremely intelligent if intelligence is measured in utilizing surroundings as tools. The Argentine Ant grew accustomed to hopping on floating leaves or debris in the Argentine flood plains and hitching rides downstream to effectively expand their territory. They were such mighty warriors with such rich resources that no other ant could challenge them.

When steamships began embarking from Argentinian shores they carried with them invasion force after invasion force of the chosen Argentine Ants. Wherever the ship was steered the ants embarked and began total and complete annihilation of all other ants and competitive life. The chosen ants have now formed a global collective. The megacolony of god’s chosen ant superpower has conquered California, Japan, and most of the Mediterranean and they are right now, on the march. Interestingly enough, the Argentine Ants recognize and accept each other no matter what continental colony they are from, and destroy all other ants they encounter.

“Societies with population explosions, that extend into the millions, are prone to large-scale, intense, tactical warfare. It’s a nature of battle only possible among communities with plenty of excess labor force.” ~Mark Moffet

Ants and humans have virtually no societal limit to their growth. The environment limits their growth, not their instincts or biological needs. Few other species on the planet operate in this manner. The colony might be hundreds, or millions or billions. No other species have societies of this proportion, and no other animal behaves the way ants and people might. No other species kills and enslaves each other and no other species practices complete confrontation in war like humans and ants.

The Argentine Ant megacolony has traversed the globe staking claim to significant areas on six continents. It is akin to human colonialism only the insect expansion and elimination is even more one-sided. No other ant it seems can stand up to the Argentine Ants. On the borders of the new intercontinental megacolonies are ant wars of total annihilation where all fall due to the Argentine Ant’s fierceness.

Human history of the collective is exactly like the history of a more prideful ant colony, only mammalian with opposable thumbs. People are the aboveground version of ants with internal skeletons instead of external ones, with hands and vocal chords instead of antennae and mandible crushers. And instead of being capable of lifting great weight like ants, people are capable of inventing great machines.

Within the colony the queen lives for decade and workers live for years. The expendable males live for a matter of weeks. Nests might have a history of multiple queens, but the colony at large has a rich history of millions of years and the collective acts with the impetus of such an age old regime. They are biologically reinforced matriarchies with a history that makes the rise of humanity just another pulse of different beings to eat off, with different kinds of leaves to ride.

Ants farm, they harvest from their surroundings, they enslave and steal from other ants, and they war on each other. Perhaps the most amazing similarity between man and ant is the fact that we build infrastructure for future use. Mankind and antkind build based largely on concerns for protection from each other, out of concern for war and others stealing from us. Ants build anthills and then build massive tunnels based on defense of the queen if enemy ants were to invade. Mankind builds in the same manner, as a means of protection.

“Oh Great Spirit who made all races, look kindly upon the whole human family and take away the arrogance and hatred which separate us from our brothers.” ~Cherokee Prayer

Mankind and antkind function, as collectives, the same, only antkind came first. One can almost imagine a curious individual coming up with all sorts of ideas watching antkind build, enslave and behave. Perhaps the original pyramids and pyramid builders saw their structures as having antkind qualities, built in symbolic homage to the antkind structure and mindset, or perhaps they were unaware that their great buildings mimicked antkind’s mounds. Typically instead of underground tunnel defenses man largely built perimeter defenses, though now we have built up walls of every sort. Now we have built weapons so destructive we could end all of antkind, mankind and all life on the planet. Our weapons remove the ability to protect ourselves with walls or otherwise.

Because of man’s inventiveness walls are now largely technological as is our ability to confront each other. Both antkind and mankind build war culture and war structure. It is a celebrated shared tradition. And in many ways what ill-informed people mistake to be art or culture is actually just symptomatic of the war machine’s institutionalized control.

It is simple to compare ants to humans and actually find reasons for building walls. It is easy to regress and behave like ants, in a collective state. And yet we are individuals, we are humans, not ants.

Antkind and mankind collective prepare for war instead of for peace. And when the opportunity presents itself, because all preparations have been made, because the opposition is seemingly prepared or is not and therefore ought to be confronted, war takes place. War takes place because it has been readied. At the borders of ant populations wars are taking place right now where millions are being killed every month. The ants kill each other because of their differences, despite the fact they are all ants. Humans when placed in bordered blocks suffer the same end, war based on differences despite our sameness. It is arguable that the predominant measure of distinction between people is differences in perception. It is easy to say that we are as beasts and therefore bound to behave as ants and yet we are much more.

The most diverse human borders have always been places of the most hair-raising and antennae flickering wars, like the areas in France and elsewhere major fighting in WWI and WWII took place. A more intense example of the ant like nature of humanized borders is demonstrated throughout The Middle East. Multiple doctrines, including the one true religion, coincide with national differences, heritage distinctions and cultural fluctuations to form borders of all sorts. And war of all sorts. It is easy to say war is inevitable for antkind and mankind both. It is easy to be unconscious and gnash with the collective, but humanity is capable of much more. In fact, our weapons of war demand that we be much more.

Humans differentiate each other for a variety of entirely absurd or historically valid reasons, but the result is the same -states with proud histories or colonies with biological impulses and the outsiders they clash with along the borders.

Humans are not so complicated for a human to understand, and we are all spurred by the same godly forces that created ants. So perhaps it is not so difficult to understand which ant is best. It is whichever ant is able to develop and evolve, which so far, for the last 150 million years at least, they have not done much by the way of. It is perhaps an impulse from beyond the beyond to not only be tribal and build walls, but to war on each other. It must be an impulse for ants do not have minds as man does. No matter if one is a tiny robotic entity of an underground ant mound or an aware human, the pulse within to kill beings like you, but not like you enough, is biological impulse.

Man is more complex than the old ant because of our complex inventions certainly, most made toward and during war. However man is complex mainly due to our consciousness. Instead of antennae we have phones. Instead of claws and teeth we have knives, guns, and nuclear bombs. We war on each other the same, we enslave each other the same, humans may have very well thought of agriculture in the first place by watching ants and building pyramids in the middle of our cities by watching ant colonies. Perhaps the Hopi were more correct than we could ever know. Perhaps long ago man was adopted by ants, or at least adopted the ant ways.

Ants were the world’s first farmers. They effectively raise livestock too and harvest from their surroundings and such behavior began about 50 million years ago, or more. Today many ants still farm or tend to fungus grown in their lairs for the colony to eat, harvesting plant material for the fungus to consume in turn. Some ants raise aphids for the colony cafeteria. One can almost envision a curious primal human ancestor watching ants do what they do and gaining numerous ideas, good, bad and ugly ideas.

Ants are the only other living thing to enslave others, the bigger ants takeover the smaller ants naturally. Or like the Argentine ants instead of enslaving they annihilate. Humanity’s enslavement of weaker people is comparable to bigger ants meeting smaller ants. Violence and war however perverse is rooted in biological aspects proven by antkind and yet mankind discusses war as tradition, or societal formation, or economics, or politics. People present reasoning for killing each other en masse, but it’s a biological response we are able to surpass. Or rather we can surpass when we think as individuals, not institutionalized society collectives. If war politics were noted to be base thinking of lower life like that of anthood, people would simply attempt to surpass the biological response with alternative higher thinking. And unlike antkind, mankind can open our hearts and minds to elevate our thinking and being.

Ants are the only animal that can accurately be compared to man, mainly because no other animals are as culturally developed with such refined caste systems and no other species kill each other on a massive organized scale. No other species wars. Mankind is more efficient at construction and destruction, we live a little longer, our colonies are more noticeable and impactful, we voyage to harvest and conquer and practices the same behavior as antkind comparable to them in our simplicity.

The comparable harvesting, farming, raising of livestock, enslavement of other ants and war organization of antkind and mankind make us remarkably similar. Perhaps of all our shared traits the most detrimental similarity is the fact that antkind and mankind both build walls. Perhaps the fact that we build walls is actually the most markedly similar characteristic between us, initiating all other similarities. Perhaps the fact that we build walls and forts and prepare for war leads to the tendency to war and plunder those outside the walls in the first place. Perhaps the wall builders alone spurred the necessity to find tools as more efficient means of warring or plundering resources or building better forts. Ants and humans build complex dwellings in part as a way to defend the collective, which appears righteous, but it is primarily the result of the induced and near permanent collective state of war.

It may be that physical and societal walls cause the war state rather than wars necessitating a walled state. Humans have been practicing cultural traditions reminiscent of quality ant relationships for thousands of years. The reason humans are so good at building is because we are always at war. Humanity has been building walls literally and figuratively since the time of Han, Nehemiah and long before.

The Western Wall or Wailing Wall is an ancient wall of high symbolic significance and attachment – people have been killing each other at the base of this wall and all walls for thousands of years. The Wailing Wall is sacred. The Great Wall of China is another physical line in the sand where people killed each other. The Great Wall is so great that it can be seen from space and everybody wants you to know that so that you think that walls are great, after all they can be seen from space. Teachers teach that walls are great. Walls are perimeters, borders, where war is readied and armament is installed and where the bordermind kicks in like that of all great ants.

It is significant to note that China did not build the wall initially to keep people out as much as to keep people inside. The most valuable resource of a nation is people, and when there is no wall people tend to leave, which was occurring too much to enable proper taxation/control. Walls also make people want to get through them in case there is something worthy behind the wall. Walls create confrontation.

It is easy to observe ants. We can observe their comings and goings and learn what they do over many lifetimes. Imagine observation of people as we would an ant hill or ant farm. Imagine we could watch the Wailing Wall or the Great Wall of China for a century or two. Imagine if we could watch what happened at the Berlin Wall during its comparatively brief existence. We would see the bordermind of antkind in mankind too. We could see the erection of the walls cause confrontation.

Walls are an example of false pride. False pride results in the bordermind. An example of false pride is being proud of how you were born; what country you’re from, the quantity of melanin you were born with or without, and the things your ancestors did. Real pride, which even that should be let go or minimalized, is being proud of having done something on your own. This false pride in walls built thousands of years ago is the same. Forget about the ancient walls and do something new with your own hands. Walls have been getting in the way of the development of our collective mentality for millennia. Walls make us more like ants than farming or harvesting or raising livestock ever could. Walls build up the infrastructure that maintains war and the border mind state of war.

Mankind builds physical walls for war to promote the bordermind in false pride. We also have the capability to build societal and spiritual walls and encase individuals and whole regions in binds. The mental and spiritual binds and encasements we are surrounded by entrap us just as walls do. And just like walls we believe the walls are protecting us when in fact they are perpetuating the mind state of war, our lacking consciousness.

We are educated primarily within walls and informed of the greatness of the Great Wall. We are informed directly and indirectly as we grow up in the education system of the value of walls. We learn from early on about all the great walls and great wars and great buildings people have erected. And while we’re learning the history of mankind we learn to stay in line and shut up. We learn to zip it shut. We learn to seal ourselves up and barricade our mind and spirit closed. We learn to conform by what we are taught and more importantly how we are taught. Institutions institutionalized instructions inform us of the value of walls. And in fact institutions are only walls so of course the institutionalized would promote such.

We learn that how much we know matters little compared to how much we know about conforming to the status quo. We close ourselves in and make our own individual walls in order to protect us from others, leaving us stuck – with ourselves. The bordermind is initiated and we live encased in spiritual and mental walls we built around ourselves through institutionalization. We are walled in by experiences by layers of ego armor and a culture of separation in post-modern society. We close ourselves in from reality in ways we shouldn’t and try to in ways we couldn’t.

No matter who is telling the story, whether Einstein or an American Indian elder, the valuable truths are eternally applicable. Questioning, seeking truth, is also eternally valuable. And so is ceasing cooperation with systems/institutions which on questioning, prove to be wrongful and based on lies. Stopping wrong is an eternally applicable and valuable act. Stopping to think leads to art and cultural development. Proactive focused inactivity spurs societal change and consciousness development of the individual, and the collective.

Open your heart and mind. Do not remain walled in by your armor as institutionally mandated in said and unsaid configurations of the status quo. Think. Be an individual, not comparable to ants running about as compelled by hollow institutions. Have a revolution inside, a revolution of consciousness and overcome the compelling nature of walled institutions.

They claim to be “patriots”.

They say that they are “Constitutionalists”.

And they say that they are opposed to the thoroughly evil and corrupt “globalists” and the “deep state” operatives of the United States political system, the intelligence community, the military-industrial complex, the pedophile and human trafficking networks, and their witting and unwitting accomplices in the mainstream and the ‘alternative’ media.

While, however, completely ignoring the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious establishments in the United States that provide the theological foundations and ‘justification’ for this evil and corruption. (But obviously, according to Chapter 13, verse 12 of the Revelation of John, “this second beast is servant to the first beast”; in other words , the religious system is servant to the political system).

Because, to them, theology (and Revelation and Prophecy) is completely irrelevant .

Although, nakedly or indirectly, they claim that ‘God is on their side’.

Although, nakedly or indirectly, they fantasize that their war against the “globalists” and the “deep state” is fully equivalent to the War of the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness.

Nonsense.

And, worse, they fantasize that they will be victorious .

(While, apparently unbeknownst to these “patriots” , the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives are determined to start World War III with North Korea/Iran/ Syria/Ukraine, et al.)

But, unfortunately, they are no less dismissive and contemptuous of the Revelations and Prophecies I have sent them than are the aforementioned “globalists” and “deep state” operatives; that is, they completely ignore the Prophecies in the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light:

http://unsealing-the-seven-seals.blogspot.com/2018/01/epitaph-on-zionist-israels-death-by.html

In other words, while the “globalists” and “deep state” operatives correspond to the Sadducees at the time of Jesus; these patriots only correspond to the Pharisees .

And, remember, the Pharisees were no less opposed to and contemptuous of the Teaching of Jesus that the Doctrine of “the resurrection” is a Doctrine of ‘Rebirth’ than were the Sadducees.

Meanwhile, according to the Message to the Church in Philadelphia in Chapter 3, verse 12 of the Revelation of John : “…I will write on him my new name.” (For more information see:

https://unsealing-the-seven-seals.blogspot.com/2015/08/censorship-by-religion.html and the included links; and, furthermore, an eagle is mentioned in the Prophecy of August, 1979:

Jung used the term “synchronicity”.

In other words, a victory of the New England Patriots over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Superbowl of February 4 would NOT be a GOOD sign.

One of the regulations up for the chopping block was the Waters of the United States rule, an Obama era move that formally extended the government’s authority to curtail pollution to small waterways.

The original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations.

In the aftermath of the rule’s implementation, interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government, and in one of them, the Supreme Court has just unanimously ruled against the government — in other words, against the Trump administration.

The ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself, but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question. The Trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges, while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue. The Supreme Court has now ruled unanimously in favor of industry interests in this case.

National Mining Association President and CEO Hal Quinn was thrilled with the outcome, commenting Monday:

‘Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision provides much needed clarity and affirms our longstanding position that the Clean Water Act empowers the federal district courts, not the courts of appeals, to initially review legal challenges to the Waters of the U.S. Rule… This win, coupled with the administration’s actions in proposing to repeal the rule and seek input on how to properly define ‘waters of the U.S.,’ puts us one step closer to addressing this deeply problematic rule and the confusion it has created.’

The administration’s apparent legal incompetence on the matter of the Waters of the U.S. rule underscores an important point — Trump and his allies have proven themselves to be at least as concerned with industry interests as they are with protecting the environment. The fact of them not, apparently, knowing what they’re doing in this case correlates with a lack of concern.

The most infamous example of this apparent preference on the part of the Trump administration is the president’s abrupt announcement that he would be pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord last year. It is worth noting, however, that it requires more to pull the U.S. out of the accord than a single belligerent announcement from the president.

More recently, the Trump administration moved to open up offshore drilling around essentially the entire U.S., from California to Florida, a move immediately met with widespread criticism.

It remains to be seen how the rule change is implemented, if at all, and there has been talk of Florida being made exempt from the administration’s plans, although that’s not certain.

What is certain, however, is the Trump administration’s plans to prioritize U.S. business interests over other interests that the president is supposed to be looking out for as the leader of the country, indicated in everything from the president’s tax policy to his environmental policy.

Tuesday morning, there was yet another school shooting, this time at the Marshall County High School in Kentucky.

As of nearly 10 AM local time, information remains sparse, but the state’s governor Matt Bevin has commented on the situation on Twitter.

He wrote:

‘Tragic shooting at Marshall County HS…Shooter is in custody, one confirmed fatality, multiple others wounded…Much yet unknown…Please do not speculate or spread hearsay…Let’s let the first responders do their job and be grateful that they are there to do it for us…’

Local news outlet Marshall County Daily wrote on Facebook shortly after 9 AM local time that “[t]here has been a shooting at Marshall County High School and the school is on lock down,” adding, “We will bring you more information as soon as it becomes available.”

Local news outlet WPSD Local 6 reported that they had “reached out to the Marshall County Sheriff’s Department and Kentucky State Police for information” and were waiting to hear back from them as of about 10 AM local time. The outlet added that their reporters had “confirmed three victims taken to hospitals.”

This incident comes just one day after a school shooting at a high school outside of Dallas, Texas, left one injured.

By Ethan Indigo Smith

Contributing writer for Wake Up World

“Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else. ~ Leonardo Da Vinci

Meditation itself is a trick. It is thought to be a complicated practice, but that is confusion. The trick begins in the following contrast: Meditation is a simple practice, and yet it enables us to understand, and to perform, complexity.

Meditation is a practice that benefits the practitioner in innumerable ways, enabling mind and body. And like a lot of magic tricks, this trick really is simply a shift of perspective — and a changed perspective can shift everything else, most immediately our thinking and feeling. If we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during the intense part of the game, we can win. If we can shift our state of being to be relaxed during stressful times, we keep our cool. Meditation is a trick of perspective.

But more than that, meditation enhances our perspective, our consciousness. The word “consciousness” is used to illustrate our deep thinking and feeling. I like to say that consciousness is the awareness of our awareness. Understanding and further practicing meditation enhances our consciousness looking inward; understanding geometry enhances our consciousness looking outward. (See: The Mandala: The Sacred Geometry of Meditation.)

Enhanced consciousness enhances our physical wellbeing and capability. If our consciousness is unwell and our body well, we might easily become upset or depressed, ultimately becoming destructive to our health both internally and externally. But if our consciousness is well and our body is unwell, we might still be joyful and productive, and we are more likely to become well. (Consciousness rules!)

Enhancing our consciousness also increases our ability to gain control over self, and our ability to accomplish in a productive and enhanced manner. For this reason, meditation is a simple way to trick ourselves to be our most happy and authentic selves.

Meditation for the Youth

“If every eight year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation.” ~ Dalai Lama

If there is one thing that can help individuals be joyful and productive it is meditation. It can help individuals to help themselves, and yet, few people are promoting it generally, and even less so among young people. My inspiration for writing my latest book, “Meditation and Geometry for The Youth“, was because I realized how lacking meditation instruction is, at home, in schools, in life and even in many yoga classes.

My other inspiration stems from a conversation I had with a meditation teacher. Long story short, I was facing an immense problem and was upset over it, and moreover I thought it was the biggest problem in the world. What the problem was is not important. The fact that I felt it was a hugely significant problem is what’s important.

The conversation went like this:

“I have been thinking a lot about the world and all the people,” I said. “I have been thinking about the problems in my life, and the lives all the people in the whole world, and I think I understand what the biggest problem in the world is. And I think if we could address just this one issue, all the world’s problems would all be solved.”

I thought at the time that if this one problem could just be solved, everything else would be OK. Have you ever felt that way? Have you ever felt that if you had just one thing, or if things were different in just one way, than all else would perfectly fall into place?

I continued to tell the teacher what the problem was, and the teacher was stunned but also grinned. As huge a global issue as it was, the problem might as well have been a small personal one. After thinking for a moment he responded,

“This problem you describe is a very serious one. And all the other problems of the world are serious too, those which are connected and those which are disconnected to this problem you describe. But what is an even bigger problem is the mess from where that problem comes from. The greatest problem in the world, no matter what anyone says, the problem from which all the other problems originate from, is the problem of our lacking consciousness and our unwell consciousness.”

I was struck. I felt silly. He of course was right. All the problems of the world, and all the problems of your world, all stem from our unwell consciousness. Every external problem begins as an internal problem, or something out of balance.

That’s where meditation can help — and to change our world, we need to start with our youth.

A strong and steady consciousness solves problems and, just as importantly, does not create them in the first place. A healthy consciousness does not react in a way that creates problems but responds thoughtfully, mindfully creating the future.

This conversation made me realize the importance of helping others learn meditation, particularly our youth, so they in turn can help themselves, so they can develop consciousness, and so that problems great and small might meet creative solutions, not just today but in the future.

“What if we learned to be at peace with ourselves from an early age? … Just imagine how much future generations of children would gain from this regular practice… if every child was able to connect to the ocean of consciousness that permeates all that is…” ~ Will Stanton

For those who cannot or choose not to provide valid documentation about their country of origin (a majority), they would have to pay back all the welfare benefits they received before even being considered for permanent status.

Breitbart Migrants who have lived on state handouts will have their citizenship applications denied in a monumental move to prevent foreign welfare abusers from living in Switzerland and on taxpayer funds indefinitely.

The new regulations will make it impossible for asylum seekers and migrants who have lived off state handouts in the last three years to become citizens even if they have lived in Switzerland as permanent residents for the required time to make a citizenship application, Kronen Zeitung reports

The previous law allowed migrants to apply for citizenship as long as they were not on state benefits at the time of their application. Along with the welfare stipulation, the new act requires migrants to demonstrate a greater level of integration than before including making them prove they have a certain number of Swiss friends and acquaintances.

Language requirements vary by canton with most expecting an intermediate level of language proficiency judged on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) at the B1 or B2 level.

While Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, asylum seekers have attempted to flood into the country through the southern Italian border. While many have used Switzerland as a transit country to reach Germany, others have remained in the Alpine state.

Various cantons and cities in Switzerland have attempted to push back against the tide of migrants by making it less appealing for them to come to the country. Late last year, the city of Zurich voted to dramatically cut benefits to failed asylum seekers who were in so-called “F-status” in which they cannot be deported.

An estimated 5,300 failed asylum seekers live in the Zürich canton with “F Status” meaning that whilst they have failed in their asylum claim, the government cannot deport them back to their home country because of potential dangers to them.

Formerly, migrants with F status received around 900 Swiss Francs (£691) per month but now will receive only the emergency fund amount of 360 Swiss Francs (£276) each month.

The legislation has gone into effect as of January 1 and will urge migrants to obtain full-time employment as well as reimburse the nation for any welfare received during their stay. Those who meet this requirement will have the right to apply for Swiss citizenship, a privilege that countless migrants have sought in order to exempt them from extradition in the event that they are convicted of a deportable offense.

The law will also make permanent residence documents granted to asylum seekers and migrants invalid as long as they have lived on welfare benefits in the last 3 years. The previous legislation provided a loophole for welfare abusers who were not receiving state handouts only during the time of their application.

Many of the migrants entering Switzerland have also come without any form of identification, making it even more difficult to process their asylum claim or deport those not approved for asylum status.

Simonetta Sommaruga revealed late last year that the government is unaware of the true identity of nine out of 10 asylum seekers in the country, mainly because they discard any documents they had, and try to claim to be refugees from Syria, which they believe will give them priority status.

This precise incident did occur for staff at a Sydney pub, who had to admit they served a steak riddled with larvae to unsuspecting customers.

The unfortunate recipient was Stella Kim, who still gets ill when recounting the night of her anniversary. A special night turned sour to say the least.

For the Ranch Hotel, located on Sydney’s north shore, the PR disaster relief is not going to be enough to save the face of the establishment.

The pub insists they are adamant about food safety, but also admit to letting these larvae sneak onto the meat before being served up.

Kim had picked the hotel as the romantic location to celebrate 1,000 days with her partner Sushil Lamichhane.

Both ordered steaks, but when they arrived it did not take long to notice the little critters.

“I couldn’t believe if this was real. It was horrible, unbelievable,” said Kim to News.com.au. “maggots were crawling over and there was a lot of them. IT was like a rotten carcass.”

The Facebook video gives a good enough idea of what it looked like for the couple, who lost their appetite for a few days afterward.

The Ranch Hotel is one of the most pre-eminent establishments in Australia. It is owned by Australian Leisure and Hospitality (ALH) Group, which is a collaboration between the Mathieson Family and Woolworths, a major retailer.

The pub issued a statement from management on their website shedding more light on the situation. Apparently of the 262 steaks, they sold that day, only one was returned for cleanliness reasons.

“Our investigation concluded that the incident was due to blowfly larva laid after the meal was cooked, as it is not possible for larvae to survive the cooking process,” read the statement.

“All our kitchen staff are experienced and accredited in food safety and The Ranch stands by its food safety record and processes.”

The pub also reached out to apologize to Kim as well as report their own mishap to local government.

The rationale given by the Pub has not convinced Ms. Kim. “The Ranch has been saying this happened instantaneously and worms burst out somewhat like the Big Bang that created our universe,” says Kim.

“If someone is (an) expert in biology and thermodynamics, please review the video so that they are educated on food handling.”

This echoes the attitude many customers of the pub have towards the rationale given by the pub – and like Kim, some of them may avoid The Ranch all-together in future because of it.

However, another example of maggots in steak indicates The Ranch was correct in their assessment.

In July, a family in Melbourne found maggots in a steak they bought in the supermarket that emerged only after cooking.

The meat had a couple of weeks before it was past its use date, and was just kept in the fridge before barbequing to keep it fresh.

According to the Skye Blackburn, an expert in entomology in the employ of food chain Aldi, has taken a closer look at the meat supplied to the family.

“It is most likely that the eggs had been laid after this meat had been cooked, and the heat of the meat has accelerated the hatching of the eggs,” says Blackburn.

Blackburn went on to explain in more detail. “Heat allows eggs the potential to hatch within minutes of being laid. Due to higher than average temperatures we’re experiencing at the moment, it is common for the life cycle of insects to occur more quickly.”",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Couple Orders Steak At Restaurant.

230,268,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/vegans-response-to-cop-sharing-photo-of-cooked-breakfast-to-support-local-farmers-goes-viral/,"When a police force in a rural part of the United States shared a picture of their cooked breakfast, which included eggs and sausage, you wouldn’t think anyone would be offended. But vegans who saw the image were furious. They began lashing out at the cops for posting the photo of the hearty breakfast.

But the North Wales Police Rural Crime Team had simply posted the photo to support the local farmers in response to the National Farmers Union (NFU) posted a “farmhouse breakfast” campaign meeting.

The cops spared no expense when cooking their breakfast to support the farmers. It includes plump breakfast sausages, dozens of perfectly poached eggs, ham, baked beans and enough slices of toast for each officer.

The image was posted to Twitter, and most people were happy to see the rural police force supporting the farmers in the area.

But one woman named Diana, who claims to be a vegan, lashed out and wrote:

“Speaking as a taxpayer, I’d prefer them to be less selective when answering questions and perhaps not post breakfast pics that offend vegetarian/vegan followers – pretty thoughtless considering the job title they have.”

Although Diana thought she had a good argument, many other members of the community were quick to retaliate. Farmer Jono Dixon shared the following in response to Diana’s post:

“It’s pathetic. The vegans are ruling the roost. They are nothing more than a menace. We as carnivores or vegetarians don’t dictate about there preferred diet so its time they stopped trolling and whining about everyone’s daily diets.”

Although people were eager to hear what Rural Crime Team leader Rob Taylor had to say in response to Diana’s vegan outburst, he said his lack of response had nothing to do with the vegans who found the breakfast feast “offensive.”

“We regularly get 1m impressions each month, and in August alone we had 1.9m impressions,” Crime Team leader Taylor said. “We just can’t answer (all inquiries) anymore as it’s a huge commitment. Over Christmas, we had too much general interaction with people from various walks of life bombarding our feed with questions, and we couldn’t cope.”

Because the rural cops care about the farmers in their area, they plan to continue to post to their Twitter page. They have about 15,000 followers and an extensive reach on social media. Most of their followers love them and support everything they do.

Although the Rural Crime Team refused to admit that the vegans had won, since Christmas Day, they have not posted any more images showcasing the eggs and bacon they eat to start off their day of crime fighting.

They did share the following post:

“We have considered all options, and from immediate effect, we will cease responding to comments and questions until further notice.”

Readers of Metro generally did not find the sausage “offensive,” but felt that way about the vegan post.

“Previous generation: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.’ Today’s generation: ‘Everything hurts.’”

231,269,awm.com,unreliable,http://awm.com/it-might-not-seem-important-but-it-is-can-you-spot-the-difference-between-the-two-tins-8/,"Recently, a federal judge ruled against McCormick & Co. and has decided to proceed in a lawsuit concerning the size of its ground pepper product, and despite the company’s request to dismiss the motion. A smaller spice seller Watkins, Inc., sued McCormick last year after discovering that the competitor had removed 25 percent of their product although using the same tins.

The picture here demonstrates what Watkins is aiming to accomplish with this case. Obviously, when compared side by side, McCormick seems to have more pepper than the Watkins container – even though McCormick is fooling its customers with a visual trick. That’s right, McCormick is essentially using an optical illusion to sell more ground pepper than Watkins. Do you think this is fair?

Although the two McCormick ground black pepper tins appear to be the same size – which they are – the one of the left contains 8 ounces of product while the one of the right only contains 6 ounces. The smaller tin on the left, which houses the Watkins ground black pepper, houses 6 ounces of product.

Even though McCormick and Watkins sell the same amount of product in their tins, McCormick uses a larger container to fool the customer into thinking they’re getting more pepper.

Because of this deceit, Watkins has sued McCormick. They argue that McCormick is deceiving their customers by reducing the amount of pepper in their non-see-through containers while not changing the size of the tin. Although the product says 6 ounces on the bottom instead of 8 ounces, it is written in tiny font that only the most astute shopper would notice.

According to the original Watkins PR release, “McCormick has been illegally “slack filling” (under-filling tins) its ground black pepper in tins in a manner that misleads retailers and consumers and is an illegal, deceptive marketing practice.”

Watkins has claimed the McCormick’s deceitful marketing tactic had hurt sale of spices. When put side by side, the customer invariably assumes that the McCormick brand is selling more ground black pepper – but in truth, the containers hold the same amount.

On the other hand, McCormick says they have not falsely advertised their product. Why? Because the correct product weight is listed on the tin.

But now McCormick isn’t just being sued by Watkins. They also face a class-action lawsuit from consumers who feel that they’ve been tricked and swindled out of their ground pepper. Have you bought the new tin of McCormick ground black pepper without knowing?

This case currently makes its way through the federal courts. As consumers, don’t trust any products you buy. Inspect them and make sure you’re getting what you think you’re getting because companies are all too eager to rip you off at any opportunity they can get.

“Integrity in the marketplace is fundamental,” said Mark Jacobs, CEO of Watkins, “For nearly 150 years Watkins has built its reputation with consumers as a premium high quality products company with impeccable honesty and business ethics. As America’s first consumer products company to offer a money-back satisfaction guarantee in 1868, we stand behind the quality and value of our products, and believe the consumer always deserves full transparency to determine value.”

Do you think McCormick is deceiving you as a customer?",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"It Might Not Seem Important, But It Is. Can You Spot The Difference Between The Two Tins?",Robert Winthrop,,[''],,,,

This profile sketch went viral on social media sites as people began to realize he is missing an ear and has a rather strange moustache – clearly something was up. Those responsible for the sketch insist only 1% of people will be able to decipher the animal in the picture within 2 minutes.

Are you able to spot it? Do you think it’s only part of an animal head rather than the whole thing? Did you spot it within two minutes? Doing these kinds of experiments are a fun way to keep your brain active and your eyes a flutter as the day rolls on.

The test is just like one of many optical illusions being shared around the internet these days. These optical illusions might be inspired by psychological testing material because it’s true that psychologists do a fair amount of visual cue testing.

Have you ever heard of the Rorschach test?

It’s a psychological test in which a patient interprets what they see in different inkblots on paper. These interpretations are recorded and analyzed by the psychologist.

But don’t worry, this face is not some kind of psychological assessment. It’s merely an optical illusion meant to surprise people and expand their minds! Can a face really look like an animal when looked at in a different way? After seeing this face we know that it can.

Since it’s not a test, there is no pressure to try and get it in under two minutes. If you do get it, then you can count yourself in the 1% of people who have incredible skill at analyzing complex images. You would make a great forensic psychologist or computer programmer (if you are not already one!).

And since it’s all for fun, we will give you a hint to help you succeed (because we really want you to succeed!)

Pay special attention to the right side of the man’s head. It is from this odd-shape that you should approach the image. Think of all the features of the face in relation to this starting point, and begin to see what two pieces match together.

We also suggest looking up animal images on Google to get an idea of the shape, size, and contours of animal heads you think might just be the one. The more you search, the closer you will come to understanding the cartoon-like design of the man’s head.

Don’t worry about doing a little research on the side – no one said it was out of bounds.

Take it as the starting point for interpreting the rest of the shapes – and if you’re lucky, you will be part of the hallowed 1%!

Think you have it down? Share it with your friends and see what they find. It may be that you all see a different animal, which in itself is quite exciting.

“It is a catch-all for blanket repression of Black activism of any kind.

The FBI has apparently chosen a new heading under which to lump Black Americans targeted for political persecution: “Black Identity Extremists.” There’s a simple explanation for the new categorization. The FBI is a bureaucracy whose day-to-day work involves drawing up lists of people and organizations to be surveilled, disrupted and prosecuted. The dramatic increase in Black “movement” activity since the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, has presented the FBI with a much larger field of targets, including youthful elements loosely grouped under the Black Lives Matter banner. When bureaucracies compile new lists, they typically file them under new names.

In a sense, the change in nomenclature is an acknowledgement by the FBI that, after nearly two generations of Black political stagnation and capitulation, there is finally a Black “movement” with the potential to upset the status quo. The leaked FBI counterterrorism division report, scooped by Foreign Policy magazine, also signifies that Black grassroots political activity is under the purview of the national security state’s War on Terror and, therefore, subject to the awesome array of repressive measures authorized to law enforcement and intelligence agencies since 9/11.

“The change in nomenclature is an acknowledgement by the FBI that there is finally a Black ‘movement’ with the potential to upset the status quo.”

COINTELPRO – the FBI’s program to ""expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize"" those designated as enemies of the state – was itself exposed as an illegal police state mechanism in the mid-1970s. Since 2001, the government’s COINTELPRO-like programs have been superseded by a far more repressive regime, inaugurated by President George W. Bush and strengthened under Barack Obama. The post-9/ll national security state has legalized the world’s most intrusive surveillance apparatus and detention without trial or charge, a system designed specifically to crush targeted ideologies – meaning, modes of thought and political identification.

It is in this context that the FBI’s umbrella designation “Black Identity Extremists” is so insidious and dangerous, in that it targets people based on their (stated, imagined or inferred) beliefs and ethnic loyalties, rather than specific criminal acts or even organizational affiliation. It is a catch-all for blanket repression of Black activism of any kind.

“Since 2001, the government’s COINTELPRO-like programs have been superseded by a far more repressive regime.”

The FBI mindset has clearly been shaped by its frustration with so-called “lone wolf” Islamic jihadists -- individual actors not directly affiliated with al Qaida or its offshoots. U.S. police and intelligence operatives speak constantly of the need to identify and neutralize Muslims in our midst that have been “radicalized” or “self-radicalized” and thus are fair game to be subjected to every tactic of entrapment and dirty tricks. The FBI views Black activists in the same light -- as potentially dangerous, “self-radicalized” threats. The counterterrorism division report cites six armed attacks on U.S. cops in the post-Ferguson period, including Dallas, Baton Rouge and New York City, as justification for its ideology-based categorization of the Black menace. Micah Johnson, who shot 11 cops in Dallas, “appeared to have been influenced by BIE ideology” based on his “journal writings and statements to police,” said the Bureau.

“BIE ideology” is whatever the FBI thinks it is. In the tortured logic of white supremacist law and order, Black identification with other Blacks is inherently subversive and a prima facie justification for surveillance. The Bureau’s BIE list could eventually accommodate every conceivable political tendency of Black thought -- including the “ideologies” resident in the venerable old NAACP, which issued a statement on the leaked FBI document.

“In a time when white supremacists are marching down city streets with loaded weapons and tiki torches — organizing rallies of terror around the country — it comes as a great shock that the FBI would decide to target black identity groups protesting police brutality and their right to exist free of harm, as a threat,” said NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson.

“The designation targets people based on their (stated, imagined or inferred) beliefs and ethnic loyalties, rather than specific criminal acts or even organizational affiliation.”

Johnson then attempts to lay the blame for this state of affairs on President Trump, who has “emboldened... right-wing extremists, white nationalists and white supremacists.” But, the FBI has been surveilling Black Lives Matter activists ever since the explosion of resistance in Ferguson. As early as December, 2014, the FBI was discovered to have tracked Black Lives Matter activists at the huge Mall of the Americas in Bloomington, Minnesota, in conjunction with state and local officers of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. In July of 2015 The Intercept reported that “Feds Regularly Monitored Black Lives Matter Since Ferguson,” exposing extensive surveillance of the rejuvenated Black movement by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.

The FBI has been spying on Black activists since its founding in the early 20th century. COINTELPRO was created during the Eisenhower administration, and never died. Under President Obama, Black activists became targets of the War on Terror, and now the FBI has conjured up a rationale to criminalize African American political thought as “Black Identities Ideology.” The Bureau will ultimately decide what this ideology actually is, and whose head it is lurking in.

“The disagreement between Coates and me is clear: his view of black America is narrow and dangerously misleading.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates’ We Were Eight Years in Power, a book about Barack Obama’s presidency and the tenacity of white supremacy, has captured the attention of many of us. One crucial question is why now in this moment has his apolitical pessimism gained such wide acceptance?

Coates and I come from a great tradition of the black freedom struggle. He represents the neoliberal wing that sounds militant about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible. This wing reaps the benefits of the neoliberal establishment that rewards silences on issues such as Wall Street greed or Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and people.

The disagreement between Coates and me is clear: any analysis or vision of our world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies, and the complex dynamics of class, gender, and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading. So it is with Ta-Nehisi Coates’ worldview.

Coates rightly highlights the vicious legacy of white supremacy -- past and present. He sees it everywhere and ever reminds us of its plundering effects. Unfortunately, he hardly keeps track of our fightback, and never connects this ugly legacy to the predatory capitalist practices, imperial policies (of war, occupation, detention, assassination) or the black elite’s refusal to confront poverty, patriarchy or transphobia.

“Coats sounds militant about white supremacy but renders black fightback invisible.”

In short, Coates fetishizes white supremacy. He makes it almighty, magical and unremovable. What concerns me is his narrative of “defiance.” For Coates, defiance is narrowly aesthetic – a personal commitment to writing with no connection to collective action. It generates crocodile tears of neoliberals who have no intention of sharing power or giving up privilege.

When he honestly asks: “How do you defy a power that insists on claiming you?”, the answer should be clear: they claim you because you are silent on what is a threat to their order (especially Wall Street and war). You defy them when you threaten that order.

Coates tries to justify his “defiance” by an appeal to “black atheism, to a disbelief in dreams and moral appeal.” He not only has “no expectations of white people at all,” but for him, if freedom means anything at all it is “this defiance.”

Note that his perception of white people is tribal and his conception of freedom is neoliberal. Racial groups are homogeneous and freedom is individualistic in his world. Classes don’t exist and empires are nonexistent.

This presidency, he writes, “opened a market” for a new wave of black pundits, intellectuals, writers and journalists -- one that Coates himself has benefited from. And his own literary “dreams” of success were facilitated by a black neoliberal president who ruled for eight years -- an example of “Black respectability, good Negro government.”

“His perception of white people is tribal and his conception of freedom is neoliberal.”

Coates reveals his preoccupation with white acceptance when he writes with genuine euphoria: “As I watched Barack Obama’s star shoot across the political sky ... I had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer. And it seemed that they loved him for this, and I thought in those days ... that they might love me too.”

There is no doubt that the marketing of Coates -- like the marketing of anyone -- warrants suspicion. Does the profiteering of fatalism about white supremacy and pessimism of black freedom fit well in an age of Trump -- an age of neo-fascism, US style?

Coates wisely invokes the bleak worldview of the late great Derrick Bell. But Bell reveled in black fightback, rejoiced in black resistance and risked his life and career based on his love for black people and justice. Needless to say, the greatest truth-teller about white supremacy in the 20th century -- Malcolm X -- was also deeply pessimistic about America. Yet his pessimism was neither cheap nor abstract -- it was earned, soaked in blood and tears of love for black people and justice.

“Does the profiteering of fatalism about white supremacy and pessimism of black freedom fit well in an age of Trump?”

Unfortunately, Coates’ allegiance to Obama has produced an impoverished understanding of black history. He reveals this when he writes: “Ossie Davis famously eulogized Malcolm X as ‘our living, Black manhood’ and ‘our own Black shining prince.’ Only one man today could bear those twin honorifics: Barack Obama.”

This gross misunderstanding of who Malcolm X was -- the greatest prophetic voice against the American Empire -- and who Barack Obama is -- the first black head of the American Empire -- speaks volumes about Coates’ neoliberal view of the world.

Coates praises Obama as a “deeply moral human being” while remaining silent on the 563 drone strikes, the assassination of US citizens with no trial, the 26,171 bombs dropped on five Muslim-majority countries in 2016 and the 550 Palestinian children killed with US supported planes in 51 days, etc. He calls Obama “one of the greatest presidents in American history,” who for “eight years ... walked on ice and never fell.”

“Coates’ allegiance to Obama has produced an impoverished understanding of black history.”

It is clear that his narrow racial tribalism and myopic political neoliberalism has no place for keeping track of Wall Street greed, US imperial crimes or black elite indifference to poverty. For example, there is no serious attention to the plight of the most vulnerable in our community, the LGBT people who are disproportionately affected by violence, poverty, neglect and disrespect.

The disagreements between Coates and I are substantive and serious. It would be wrong to construe my quest for truth and justice as motivated by pettiness. Must every serious critique be reduced to a vicious takedown or an ugly act of hatred? Can we not acknowledge that there are deep disagreements among us with our very lives and destinies at stake? Is it even possible to downplay career moves and personal insecurities in order to highlight our clashing and conflicting ways of viewing the cold and cruel world we inhabit?

I stand with those like Robin DG Kelley, Gerald Horne, Imani Perry and Barbara Ransby who represent the radical wing of the black freedom struggle. We refuse to disconnect white supremacy from the realities of class, empire, and other forms of domination -- be it ecological, sexual, or others.

The same cannot be said for Ta-Nehisi Coates.

“Coates has benefitted from the neo-liberal brand of Black leadership that grew in strength during the era of Obama.”

I began writing for Black Agenda Report over four years ago. As a ""non-Black"" identified person of color, Black Agenda Report's commitment to the Black Radical Tradition was an inspiration in a period marked by deep political reaction. Black Agenda Report did not betray its political principles in the face of the first Black President at a time when there was immense pressure to do so. Black Agenda Report not only provided a forum for Black left political thought and action, but also advanced necessary debates in service of movements for social transformation in the Black American community and oppressed communities worldwide. The conversation that has emerged from Cornel West’s critique of Coates is one that BAR has amplified since its inception and should not be left in the polluting grips of the Black political class and their white liberal allies.

Cornel West essentially outlined the political program of the Black Radical Tradition by exposing the political emptiness of Ta-Nehisi Coates. Coates has made exorbitant profit from book sales and articles for publications such as The Atlantic. His recent text, Eight Years in Power capitalized on the rise of Donald Trump in the aftermath of the Obama era. Coates has benefitted from the neo-liberal brand of Black leadership that grew in strength during the era of Obama. His work on reparations, white supremacy, and the Obama-Trump phenomenon has given him a bright national spotlight. However, with one article, Cornel West illuminated how Coates has done little more than build a comfortable career in place of genuine service to the masses of poor and oppressed people in the Black community and beyond.

“The conversation that has emerged from Cornel West’s critique of Coates is one that BAR has amplified since its inception and should not be left in the polluting grips of the Black political class and their white liberal allies.”

West’s intervention is not without a contextual basis. The history of Black political thought and action has always been rife with contested debate in the struggle to chart the correct path forward to substantive emancipation. Individual Black leaders and organizations have debated questions such as the viability of Black nationalism, the difference between civil rights and human rights, and the role of socialist ideology in the Black freedom movement, to name a few. These debates were products of concrete struggle over the trajectory of the Black polity. They provided much needed clarity for the advancement of Black liberation.

Yet when West made clear that Coates’ inability to challenge Wall Street and War was a rebuke of the Black Radical Tradition, there were many who quickly sought to distance themselves from the substance of West’s position. West was channeling W.E.B. Du Bois, Fannie Lou Hammer, Claudia Jones, Malcolm X, and the Black Panther Party when he challenged Coates’ much-heralded body of work. What Black Agenda Report calls the Black political class has never wanted anything to do with these stalwarts of the Black Radical Tradition. This was evident in the Guardian when it published responses to West’s critique from prominent Black academics and Black activists. Of the four interviewed, only one engaged with the substance of the debate. None openly took sides.

“West was channeling W.E.B. Du Bois, Fannie Lou Hammer, Claudia Jones, Malcolm X, and the Black Panther Party when he challenged Coates’ much-heralded body of work.”

West has received largely negative responses for his critique of Coates. His opposition to Wall Street and war is a fundamental threat to US imperialism and thus the patronage the system endows the Black political class. Criticism of West has centered on his so-called lackluster approach. Black Lives Matter network leader Patrisse Cullors claimed that the debate was ""not definitive to our communities."" One can only wonder how silencing Cornel West serves anything but the interests of the parasitic imperialist system that has subjected Black America to a state of precarity for centuries.

Perhaps the worst example thus far was published in an article in The Intercept. Infamous progressive Naomi Klein and Black Lives Matter leader Opal Tometi penned a statement that urged readers to forget about the West and Coates debate. The focus of our attention should instead be on the need to build a ""multiracial"" movement against the US empire. The piece lectures readers about the importance of fighting empire and war yet reduces West's arguments to ""narrow nationalism."" Sloppy organization and a lengthy word count do nothing but prove that the authors of the article had as their primary interest the erasure of the Black Radical Tradition in favor of a color-blind approach to organizing.

The Klein/Tometi piece lectures readers about the importance of fighting empire and war yet reduces West's arguments to ""narrow nationalism.""

There is no time to reduce West's criticism of Coates to foolish infighting. Rather than insulting West's critique as ""not definitive"" to our communities, we should be taking the time to learn from it. Internationalism has been a fundamental aspect of the Black Radical Tradition from the very outset of its development. Whether Coates has or hasn't addressed the questions of War and Wall Street throughout his illustrious career is not of primary concern. The concern is that his body of work is less reflective of the Black Radical Tradition and more so the perils of collaboration with imperialism. West questions Coates' commitment to the Black Radical Tradition by citing both a record of inaction on the questions of Wall Street and war and a tendency to align with the Obama wing of imperialism toward profitable ends.

These are questions that Black Agenda Report has placed on the forefront of discussion long before West applied them to Coates’ work. Black Agenda Report has been the only left political journal to consistently expose the Black political class and its role in the reproduction of imperialism’s exploitative social relations. Black Agenda Report is the lone Black left journal that provides both news and analysis on issues of war, racism, and capitalism. The Black Agenda Report team has given ample space for the people to learn from the political debate occurring in movements such as Cooperation Jackson. Editor Bruce Dixon has been digging through the archives to highlight Black Agenda Report as the only consistent voice when it comes to coverage of the US-led invasion of Libya in 2011 or the Black political class’ support for the demise of Net Neutrality.

“Black Agenda Report has been the only left political journal to consistently expose the Black political class and its role in the reproduction of imperialism’s exploitative social relations.”

West’s engagement with Coates is thus nothing new to either Black Agenda Report or the Black Radical Tradition from which it sprung. Black America has historically led the way in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism from inside “the belly of the beast.” Imperialism by its very nature has required the destruction of Black self-determination, the looting of wealth, and the denial nationhood to maximize the profits of capital. The struggle for Black self-determination has thus produced debates within Black leadership concerning the correct direction for not only Black people, but also for the entire human family. It is the duty of progressive and revolutionary forces in the US to take sides in such debates, not discourage them.

This writer decided to contribute to Black Agenda Report because the debate over the questions of war, Wall Street, and the Black Radical Tradition must be met with a revolutionary movement dedicated to the development of a new society free of exploitation. Black Agenda Report has shown time and again that it is committed to creating favorable conditions for such a movement to emerge. The Black left journal spends each week raising the people’s level of political development. Working class and oppressed people such as myself find this model attractive. In a moment where mass fear is as palpable as class war, the link between the battle of ideas and the struggle for a new world has become increasingly clear. Cornel West has consistently fought in both struggles. The same cannot be said for Coates.

Cornel West has taken the best from the Black Radical Tradition to raise important questions about the role Coates’s work plays in the future of humanity. Ta-Nehisi Coates was placed at the center of the critique but by no means did West single him out without purpose or strategy. Revolutionary ideas are the foundation blocks for the new world we seek. Black Agenda Report has amplified the ideology of the Black left reflected in West’s critique of Coates since the publication’s inception. War, racism, and Wall Street are interconnected phenomena that make up the skeleton of the class war before us. Cornel West has taken a side in this war and has challenged us to do the same, whether Coates responds to West or not.

“Obama never gave Eric Garner or his family the justice that he had the power to give.”

“I felt the same pain that my father felt on that day when he was screaming, ‘I can’t breathe.” -- Erica Garner

Erica Garner was only 27-years old when she died on December 30, 2017. She was the mother of two children, one of whom was eight years old and the other just four months old. Ms. Garner became famous when father, Eric Garner, was murdered by New York City police on July 14, 2014. The killing was filmed and the world heard his last words, “I can’t breathe.”

Most police murder victims die unknown and their deaths are rarely even investigated. Garner was killed when thousands of people mobilized in mass protest across the country over the issue of police homicides. Because of that pressure the City of New York went through the motions of prosecuting his killer, Daniel Pantaleo. But the grand jury in the conservative and mostly white borough of Staten Island refused to indict. Pantaleo is still on the force and even received an increase in pay when he earned over time for court appearances.

Ms. Garner was left to deal with her father’s death as best she could. She was an ordinary young woman, inexperienced in political activism or media relations. Yet she overcame what would be considered short comings by taking the simplest and most basic action. She spoke up.

“Obama’s response to demands was phony, meant to give the appearance of action when none was taken.”

Barack Obama’s Justice Department only prosecuted two cases of police brutality and Eric Garner’s was not among them. Obama’s response to demands was phony, meant to give the appearance of action when none was taken. He sent scoundrels like Al Sharpton to Ferguson, Missouri but only for show. Obama would even meet with activists and family members when he thought he could get political cover by doing so. But he never gave Eric Garner or his family the justice that he had the power to give.

He met Ms. Garner on one occasion but because of her agitation. In July 2016 Alton Sterling and Philando Castille also died in on-camera police murders. In Dallas, Texas a man named Micah Xavier Johnson exacted revenge by killing five police officers in that city. Johnson was himself killed by police using a remote bombing device to do the deed. Gavin Long did the same in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, killing three police before he too died at the hands of other officers.

“Pantaleo is still on the force and even received an increase in pay when he earned over time for court appearances.”

The realization that Johnson and Long changed the political conversation forced the Obama administration to hastily stage a dog and pony show entitled “The President and the People: A National Conversation.” Ms. Garner was invited to attend the nationally televised town hall along with other relatives of police murder victims. But the attempt at window dressing was not completely successful because she refused to be silent.

The ulterior motives were so obvious that Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrice Cullors called the town hall “a shit show.” “It was honestly one of the worst experiences you could’ve put families through. It was all about apologizing about the cops, it was just a mess.” In short, it was vintage Obama. He wanted to dampen black people’s justifiable anger and put a happy face on the system’s criminality.

“When her words threatened to ruin the Obama effort at damage control she was allowed to speak with him briefly.”

To her credit, Erica Garner exposed emperor Obama’s nakedness. Neither she nor any of the other families were permitted to ask questions. She loudly proclaimed that they had been used, “railroaded” as she put it. She asked an important question, “A black person has to yell to be heard?” Of course the answer is yes. It has always been yes. When her words threatened to ruin the Obama effort at damage control she was allowed to speak with him briefly.

Video of the conversation shows him in all of his hollow glory. He was clearly uninterested in Ms. Garner, mouthing condolences but making excuses for inaction. He barely hid the irritation he felt as he was forced to speak with her.

But Erica Garner’s best efforts couldn’t move the system and she had challenges in her personal life as well. Early in 2017 she was pregnant and assaulted by her child’s father. According to her mother she was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and suffered a heart attack shortly after giving birth. A second heart attack on Christmas Eve killed her.

“Obama wanted to dampen black people’s justifiable anger and put a happy face on the system’s criminality.”

The stories of the survivors end this way all too often. They suffer trying to do what it is impossible, act on their own against a system that sanctifies police murder of black people. One could say that Pantaleo killer her when he killed her father. Then again the Obama administration chose not to give her justice and they were accessories too. As a black woman she lived in a society that didn’t value her life and that fails to provide basic health care outcomes. There are many perpetrators in this sad story.

But she isn’t alone. Ramsey Orta filmed Eric Garner’s death and police retaliated by setting him up in a drug deal. He is serving four years in prison and says he regrets having ever been involved. Erica Garner is one of many NYPD victims. Her story is one of bravery but also one of caution. Just weeks before her fatal heart attack she spoke of how “the system beats you down.” All too often the beat down is deadly.

Remember those optical illusion posters that were hung all over the place. They became so addicting so fast that malls even had dedicated stores where they were sold. Well, we have some good news…they just may be coming back, all thanks to Blake Lively. The famed actress recently posted one of the stereograms to her Instagram account, alongside the comment…

“What a hole decided the world no longer needed these?!?!”

And we are happy she did because they provide hours of fun for all ages.

At first glance, the illusions look like giant posters made out of colorful dots, but once you look closer and have a staring contest with the posters, you soon learn that there is much more to the images than a bunch of dots. Actual pictures pop out at you and they appear to be so real that you will be second guessing whether or not the subject in the illusion is going to reach out and touch you.

So, how did the artists manage to put together a bunch of tiny dots to reveal an image?

Well, it’s based on a whole lot of research that tested what the human eye can detect and is based on depth perception and the ability to view things in three dimensions.

Lively’s post was shared when she was on a mission to promote her movie, “The Shallows,” and the illusion is certainly fitting for the actresses latest film.

You can give the illusion a try just by staring into the black and blue dots for several seconds. By staring at the image like this, it causes your eyes to unfocus slightly. Just a warning…your eyes might cross, which can be painful for some. Another way to see the image pop out at you is to start out by standing close to the image, then slowly move away from it while continuing to stare. Soon, you will be able to witness the image coming to life.

This particular image has internet users going wild since it’s not all that easy to see.

According to the Magic Eye viewing tips, it is actually easier to look at the image on a piece of paper instead of on a computer screen.

If you are having trouble detecting the image, it may help to know that it relates to Lively’s movie, “The Shallows,” which is based on a surfer’s struggle to shore after she is attacked by a great white shark. The movie is sure to leave you in fear of being in open water, as it includes horrific moments of one woman’s struggle to survive. It is one film that is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat.

It will be interesting to see if Magic Eye posters get popular again, since Lively’s popular post. The good thing about them is that they have something for everyone and they are certainly a conversation piece if you have one hanging on the wall in your home.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"Hidden Image In Optical Illusion Is Causing People To Freak Out, Can You Spot It?",Kate Anslinger,,[''],,,,

One great way to take a break but not go completely brain dead while on the web is to do those interesting web puzzles that you come across that really make you think about what you are doing, and require some extra thought than compared to just browsing and shopping.

This puzzle will probably get you very frustrated but has quite a simple answer.

Take a look at this block of text, and see if you can find your name in here:

If you can’t, don’t worry because most people typically get tricked up when they start looking for their name and realize that you need to actually look for “your name” within the block of text.

Tricky!

Take another look and see if you can find your name now. You should be able to spot it three times.

If you give up and simply cannot locate your name, check out the video below to see the answer for yourself! The trickiest one is at the top because it is backward.

This type of puzzle is actually the type of puzzle that is most recommended by brain doctors for keeping mental health in tip top condition.

This is because when you do these puzzles, your brain is not rapidly multitasking, which really wears and tears on the frontal lobe in your head which puts us under a lot of stress, not only in our brains but in our bodies as well.

When we are under stress, our body emits a toxic hormone called cortisol into the memory sector of the brain. This means that when you multitask, you are slowly decreasing your memory capabilities!

That is why if you just take some time out of the day to stop your hectic work day, cut your constant connection with technology, and sit back and relax to do these puzzles, you will be at a better overall health if you do these puzzles over time repeatedly.

They help you relax, unwind, and prevent that nasty hormone from being released that makes us feel awful.

If you want more help keeping your brain in that tip top working order, here is another puzzle that you can do. This one is a bit more centered around for children, however, it still has the same effect on your head because it will help divert your attention from the rest of the bust things going on around you.

You should be able to find six hidden words. They are pretty well stuck in there too, except for the obvious one on the side of the boy who is sitting on the couch and reading.

While many of them are not as challenging as you might imagine, this one is certainly going to get you scratching your head. It is a simple drawing that will make you look twice, three times or four times. It is that confusing. The simple sketch was popular back in the 1980s and was recently posted to Reddit where it went viral overnight.

Just take a look at the image with one question in mind – how many legs does this elephant have? Does it have four like normal elephants? Or more like some kind of alien critter? Check it out below and tell me what you see in the comments below now!

Although the image has been debated at length in the discussion forums of Reddit and other websites, people cannot determine the number of legs on this mammal. It is confusing and uncertain.

Because the picture is sketched in black and white, men and women have numerous answers for it. While common sense tells us that there should be one leg, other people insist that the elephant has more than that – namely five legs.

But the true answer might make you angry. Take a closer look at the picture, because this elephant has only one leg.

People have shared their reasons why. But it seems clear if you look at it. Many of the legs are only half drawn. They are made to look complete but they’re not. The upper part of the limb starts the sketch but it doesn’t finish. Instead the feet are drawn in the “negative” space, which makes it very confusing for people.

Nevertheless, explanations have come in droves. Here was one:

“The reason you’ve having trouble with this image is due to the fact that the artist responsible for this image was very clever. The only correct elephant leg in the drawing is the back left leg. That leg is completely intact, but the others aren’t. If you look very closely, you’ll see that the rest of the legs have the foot missing from them. Basically, the artist chopped the feet off of the legs and put the images of the feet between the actual legs. Look closely at the image and you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about.”

Although this is a very convincing answer, many people refuse to believe that an elephant can have fewer than four legs. They don’t care if the legs don’t have feet.

Readers on MailOnline shared their reaction to the elephant drawing:

“This picture was doing the rounds when I was at school, about 100 years before the Internet was even a twinkle in old Tim Berners-Lee’s eye!” “I can see 4 legs but the way the gaps between them have been drawn it is to deceive the viewer that there are 5.”

How many legs do you see on this elephant?

He gave his class a tricky riddle to solve over the break, thinking no one would be able to solve it, but giving their brains something to grapple with none-the-less. However, he and most of the Twitter world were as surprised as ever to find out that some kids actually do have all the answers to the most complex issues in life.

Turner should know a thing or two about what young kids are capable of. He is a 37-year old teacher living in the San Fransisco Bay Area who has spent the past seven years teaching first- and second- graders. He actually has a real love for riddles because of the conceptual work it makes kids do. It is a Turner tradition to start each week with a different kind of riddle and let’s the kids grapple with it and seek and answer.

This one particular week the riddle went like this: “I am the beginning of everything, the end of everywhere. I am the beginning of eternity, and the end of time and space. Who am I?”

The first one to guess the riddle gave an impressively deep answer: death.

While the whole room fell silent over the answer, it was in fact not the right one! Turner took to Twitter to share the surprising turn of events. He mentioned that an “awed, somber, reflective hush fell over the class” when the word was written out on the board. Clearly, it was a lot for young kids to consider the realities of such an immense concept as death.

In that moment, Turner did not want to reveal the actual correct answer to the riddle, was is the letter ‘e’.

“This was a very typical first-grade moment; guesses to riddles are always great, and often the ‘wrong’ answers are better than the correct ones.”Turner later told the education news outlet TODAY Parents.

The first answer was not the only one to reference finitude or the nothingness present in the world. Some of the other guesses were “NOT everything”, “the end”, or even the most surprising: “nothingthing.”

What is even funnier is that when Turner actually revealed the answer to the riddle, most of the kids were not impressed. Perhaps it had to do with the grammatical nature of the joke, a reference to word-play that is likely lost on 7 and 8-year-olds.

According to Turner, the collection of answers pertaining to death was actually indicative of the topics that young kids often speak about. He points out that young kids face death on a regular basis, whether in the form of aging grandparents or a dying pet. They are just as fascinated by it as anyone, and take pleasure in seeking some resolution to it finally happening.

While it might no be a surprise to Turner, it sure is a surprise to most of us who imagine our kids talking about playing outside and imaginary worlds. The un-groundedness of kids is something we assume without paying attention to all the different things they like to speak about – including death.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,A First-Grader’s Answer To Teacher’s Puzzle Of The Day Has The Internet In Stitches,Ruth Harris,,[''],,,,

UK Telegraph (h/t TROP Staff at the Park Avenue Girls’ High School, in Stoke-on-Trent, said paper was available from the school office, but because most of the students were Muslim, they preferred to wash rather than wipe.

The Ofsted report stated: “At the time of the inspection, it was not the school’s common practice to provide soap for pupils’ hand-washing, toilet roll in the toilets or suitable drinking water.

“Toilet paper is available from the school office when pupils request it. Pupils told inspectors that they sometimes avoided using toilets for the whole school day because of this.” But headteacher Abdul Ghafoor Salloo defended the policy, insisting the school catered for the cultural needs of the pupils.

“The children they do use the toilets and traditionally, because we are Muslim, we wash, not only wipe. There are facilities for pupils to clean themselves,” he said. It might be hard for someone who doesn’t traditionally wash to understand and washing is better than wiping clean. “The Ofsted inspector said there has to be toilet rolls, we said there are always toilet rolls but they are not always out – so what?”
